"There's no a better gifts in this world than a book about Hitler. So thank you so much. I I've gotten a gift when I was what we're just talking about flying the watch from Joe Rogan and this almost feeds it. So, so tell me what this particular book on Hitler is. So this is volume two."
"Do you think he was born this way, that charisma, whatever that is, or was it something he developed strategically? That's like the question you apply to some of the great leaders. Was he just a mad man who had the instinct to be able to control people one in the room together with them? Or is this like,"
"And also he was able to convince the generals and military. I mean, that was, that was very interesting. And to convince Chamberlain and the other political leaders, there's, that's something I often think about. Cause we just reading books about these people. I think about what, like Jeffrey Epstein, for example. Oh yeah. Like evil people, not evil. People have done evil"
"Things. Let's not go to the Dan Carlin people that do evil things. I wonder what they like in a room, because I know quite a lot of intelligent people that were, did not see, did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein and spend time with them. And not, we're not bothered by in the same sense Hitler. It seems like he was able to get just even on it before he had power because people get intoxicated by power and so on. They want to be close to power. But even before he had power, he was able to convince people and it's unclear."
"Like, is there something that's more than words? It's like the way you, I mean, people talk, tell stories about like this piercing look and whatever, all that kind of stuff. I, I wonder if that, if that's somehow part of it, like that has to be the base for, of any of these charismatic leaders, you have to be able to in a room alone, be able to convince anybody of anything."
I wonder if that was a different person because you were recording then offline.
"For me. So he's really aware of the narratives of story. I mean, that people have talked about that all comes from the tabloid media of the, from New York and so on. He's a master of that, but I've also heard stories of just in private. He's a really, I don't want to overuse the word charismatic, but just like, he is a really interesting, almost like friendly, like a good person. Like, like that's what I heard a, I haven't heard actually surprising the same thing about Hillary Clinton. And like, I can't tell you, but like the, the way they present themselves is perhaps very different than they are as human beings."
"One-on-one that, that's something maybe that's just like a skill thing. Maybe, maybe the way they present themselves in public is actually they're they're I mean, almost their real self. And they're just really good in private one-on-one to go into this mode of just being really intimate in some kind of human way."
"That's awesome. Great apologetic. He's like, you guys want a diet Coke."
"It's like, you are your own, like, life is great."
"He believes that he, what, what, he kind of implies that he is one of, if not the greatest presidents in American history, like people kind of laugh at this, but there's quite, I mean, there's quite a lot of people, first of all, that make the argument that he's the greatest president in history. Like I've heard this argument being made. And I mean, I don't know what the, first of all, I don't care. Like you can't make an argument that anyone is the greatest. That's just, that's just, I, I come from a school of like being and modest and so on. If they give him Michael G you can't have that conversation."
"Okay. So I like the he's humble enough to say like, yeah,"
"Do you think he actually believes that? Or is that something he understands will create news and also perhaps more importantly, piss off a large number of people. Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing the motions of the public or does he well, or, and does he believe when he looks in the mirror? I'm one of the greatest men"
"It's an interesting question. Whether knowing history, being a student of history is, is productive or counterproductive. I tend to assume I really respect people who are deeply like well-read in history, like presidents that are almost like nerd history nerds. I admire that. But maybe that gets in the way governance. I don't know. It's not, it's not, you know, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate to my own beliefs, but it's possible that focusing on the moment and the issues and letting history, it's like first principles thinking, forget the lessons of the past and just focus on common sense of reasoning through the problems"
"Yeah. That's I think is really interesting. Speeches were amazing. I'm also a sucker for great speeches because I I'd done to see the role of the president as impart, like inspire and chief sort of to be able to, I mean, that's what great leaders do, like CEOs of companies and so on, establish a vision, a clear vision, and like, like hit that hard. But the way you establish the vision, isn't just like not to dig at Joe Biden, but like, like sleepy, boring statements, you have to sell those statements and you have to, you know, you have to do it in a way where everybody's paying attention."
"Everybody's excited. Yeah. And that Teddy was, was definitely one of them. Obama was that I think at least early on, I, I don't know, was incredible at that. It does feel that the modern political landscape makes it more difficult to be inspirational in a sense because everything becomes bickering and division. I do want to ask you please about Trump. So you're now a successful podcaster. I've talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan. And Joe's not interested in talking to Trump. It's just fascinating. I try to dig into like, why, what would you interview Trump on like realignment, for example."
"And do you think it's possible to do a two, three hour conversation with him where you will get at something like human or you get something like we were talking about the facade he puts forward. Do you think you'd get, get past that? No, I don't."
"I think he's a different human now after the election, do you think that"
"Yeah. He's a fascinating study. I still, I feel there's a hope of me that there'll be a podcast, like, like a Joe Rogan, like a long form pockets where it's something could be, you know, and you're actually a really good person to do that where you can have a real conversation that looks back at the election and reveal something on us. But perhaps he's thinking about running again. And, and so maybe he'll never let down that guard. Yes. But like, you know, I, I just love it when there's this switch in people where you start, start looking back at your life and wanting to tell stories, like, you know, trying to extract wisdom and like realizing you're in this new phase of life or like the battles have all been fought now you're this old, like former warrior."
"And now you can tell the stories of that time. And it seems like from it's still at it, like the young warrior he is, he's not in the mode of telling stories"
"Amazing Avenue, he almost gotten stronger and he was one of the most diverse, like the climate there's so many people attacking him so much hatred, so much love and hatred. And it was just, it was, I mean it was whatever it was, it was a quite massive phone and, and a fascinating study. I, if we, if we stick on Hitler for just a minute, what lessons do you take from that time? Do you think it's a unique moment in human history, the world war II. I mean both Stalin and Hitler, you know, is, is it something that's just an outlier in all of human history in terms of the atrocities or is there the lessons to be learned?"
"You mentioned, mentioned offline that you're not just a student of the entirety of the history, but you're also fascinated by just different like policies and stuff. Like what's the immigration policy, what's the policy on science,"
"Yeah. I mean, sometimes it's hard to predict what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive, the system that you create. Right. Right. And the case, because especially when it's novel kind of situations, when Trump likes you created a pretty novel situation and a lot of the things that we've seen in the 20th century or very novel systems where people are very optimistic about the outcomes, right. And then it turned out to not have the results that they predicted. I, in terms of like things being unchanged for the past hundred years and so on, can you like Wikipedia style or maybe like in, in a musical form, like I'm only a bill described to me."
"I don't know what the rest of the song goes, but let's, let's leave that to people's imagination. How, how does this whole thing work? How does the U S political system work? The three branches is, how do you think about the system we have now, if you were to try to describe if aliens showed up and asked you, like they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing. Should we destroy you and B as you plead to avoid destruction, well, how, how would you describe how this thing works? I would say"
"That's how I would describe it. So the,"
"So there's a balance of power that's because it's multiple branches, there's a tension and a balance to it as designed by those original documents. What, which is the most dysfunctional, the branches, which is your favorite, like in terms of talking about systems and like what's the greatest of concern and what is the greatest source of benefit in your view?"
"Do you think at this point, the model power that the president has is corrupting to the, to their ability to lead well, is this is, you know, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. Are we, is there too much power in the, in the presidency?"
"Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial detentions to it. But so what you're saying is the true power currently lies with the autopilot. Yeah. K deep state."
"Well, listen for me personally, but also from an engineering, I just talked to Jim Keller is just, this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate in when you're trying to innovate and design new products, right? So like that's the, that's what first principles thinking requires. It's like, we don't give a shit. What was done before the point is what is the best way to do it? And it seems like the current government government in general, probably bureaucracies in general are just really good at being lazy about never having those conversations and just, it becomes this momentum thing that nobody has, the difficult conversations."
"It's become a game within a certain set of constraints and they never kind of do revolutionary tasks. But you did say that the presidency has power, but you're saying that more power than the others. And that power has to be coupled with like focused intentionality. Like you have to keep hammering the thing"
"Okay. That's really fast. And you make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump are probably playing here to the system. You're making me think that maybe you can correct me that because I'm thinking of like Elon Musk, who's major success, despite everything is, is hiring the right people. Exactly. And like creating those thousands, that structure of a thousand people. So maybe a president has power in that. If there were exceptionally good at hiring the right people,"
"Are you able to steer the ship way more than two degrees if you hire the right people? So like, it's almost like a Walmart was not good at hiring the right people,"
"Back and say, Oh, president can't. But that means you're just suck at hiring."
"What role does money play in all of this as money, huge influence in politics, super PACS, all that kind of stuff, or is this, is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with? Because from the outsider's perspective, it seems to have, that seems to be one of the fundamental problems with modern policy."
"So that's interesting. So it was one. So in that sense, representative government has done a pretty good job of representing the state of culture and the people and so on. Yeah. Can I ask you in terms of, you know, the deep state and conspiracy theories, there's a lot of talk about, again, from an outsider's perspective. If I were just looking at Twitter, it seems that at least 90% of people in government are pedophiles and then 90, 90, 95%. I'm not sure what that number is. If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube, I would think most of the world's a better file. I would almost feel like right."
"A pedophile, I would start to wonder like, wait, like, what am I a pedophile to? I'm either a communist or a pedophile or both, I guess. Yeah. That's going to be clipped up. Thank you, internet. I look forward to your emails, but is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories that give you pause or sort of the flip side, the response, a lot of conspiracy theories. It's like, no, the reason this happened is because it's a combination of just incompetence. So where do you land on some of these conspiracy areas?"
I think most
"And we don't know which ones, I don't know which one that's the problem."
That's all I have to say. That's it. I have the sense that the government
"Has information hasn't revealed, but it's not like they're, I don't think they're holding. There's like a green guy sitting there in a row. Cause they just, they have seen things. They don't know what to do with the so it's like, they're confused. I guess you're"
"It's revealing exactly that they don't know. And then they're in the process. There's a lot of fierce tied up in that first looking and competent in the public eye. Nobody wants to be looked that way. And the other is like in revealing it, even though they don't know, maybe China will figure it out. Exactly. So like, we don't want China to figure it out first. And so that all those kinds of things result in basically secrecy, then that damages the trust in institutions on one of the most fascinating aspects. Like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind of is there life intelligent life out there in the universe. So that's one of them, but there there's other ones, like for me, when I first came across, actually Alex Jones was a nine 11."
"I remember like, cause I was, I was in Chicago. I was thinking like, Oh shit, are they going to hit Chicago too? That's where everybody was thinking, yeah, everybody, everybody was thinking like, what does this mean? It's get what scale, what? I mean, trying to interpret it. And I remember like looking for information that's but like what, what happened? And I remember not being satisfied with the quality of reporting and figuring out like rigorous, like here's exactly what happened. And so people like Alex Jones stepped up and others that said like, there's some shady shit going on and it sure as hell look like there's shady shit going on. So like, and I still stand behind the fact that it seems like there's not, there's not enough."
"Like it wasn't good job of being honest and transparent and all those kinds of things,"
"Yeah. So th those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting. I mean, there's other ones for me personally, that touched a sort of institution. That means a lot to me is MIT and, you know, Jeffrey Epstein."
"Eric Weinstein, I've heard is right. Oh boy. So I listen, I'm still in. And Eric is fascinating and like arrogance full on saying that he was a Mossad or whatever. Yeah. There's something, something much, much bigger. And there's, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell, all the, all those stories is like, you could dig deeper and deeper that the Jeff is just like the tip of the iceberg. I just think he's an exceptional charismatic, listen, this isn't speaking from confidence or like deep understanding of the situation. But from my speaking with people, he's just seems like, at least from the side of his influence and interaction with researchers, he just seems like somebody that was exceptional charismatic and actually took interest."
"He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things, but he took interest in them. So he knew how to stroke the egos of a lot of powerful people, like, well, like in, in different kinds of ways, I suppose I don't know about this because I don't have like, if a really, okay, this is, this is weird to say, but I have an ability. Okay. I think women are beautiful. I like women. But like if, if like a supermodel came to me or something like, it's like, I'm able to reason, it seems like some people are not able to think clearly when there's like an attractive woman in the room."
"And I think that was one of the tools he used to manipulate people. Interesting. I don't know, listen to like the pedophile thing. Right. I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts, but like, it seems like what, like looking out into the world, like there's a, like the me too movement have revealed that there's a lot of like weird, like creepy people out there. I don't know. But I think it was just one of the many tools that he used to convince people and manipulate people, but not in some like evil way, but more, just really good at the art of conversation."
"Yeah. And just winning people over on the side. And then by building through that process, building a network of other really powerful people and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit with powerful people. Yeah. Like building up a kind of implied power of like, like we did some shady shit together. So we're not like you're going to help me out on this extra thing I need to do now. And that builds and builds and builds to where able to actually control, like have quite a lot of power without explicitly having like a strategy meeting."
"And I think a single person, or yeah, I think a single person can do that. Can start that ball rolling. And over time it becomes a group thing. Like, I don't know if Julie Maxwell's involved or others and yeah, over time that becomes almost like a really powerful organization that wasn't, that's not a front for something much deeper and bigger, but it's almost like maybe it's cause I love cellular automata man, a system that starts out as a simple thing with simple rules can create incredible complexity. Yes. So I just think that we're now looking in retrospect, it looks like an incredibly complex system that's operating in, but like that's just because it's, you know, there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein's in, in my perspective that the simple thing just was successful early on and builds and builds and builds and builds."
"And then there's a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects of the system helped it get bigger and bigger and more powerful and so on. So the final result is, I mean, listen, I'm, I have a pretty optimistic, I have a, I tend to see the good in people. And so it has been heartbreaking to me in general, just to see, you know, people I look up to not have the level of integrity I thought they would, or like the strength of character, all those kinds of things. And it seems like you should be able to, to see the bullshit that is Jeffrey Epstein. Like when you meet them. Right. We're not talking about like Eric Weinstein, like one or two or three or five interactions, but like there's people that had like, like years of relationship with them."
"Yeah. And I don't know. I, I'm not sure when, after he was convicted, after he was convicted. Yeah. There's there's stories. I mean, I don't need to sort of, I honestly believe, Okay. Here's the open question I have. I don't know how many creepy sexual people that are out there. I don't know if there's like, like the people I know the faculty and so on. I don't know if they have like a kink that I'm just not aware of. That was being leveraged. Because to me, it seems like if, if, if people aren't, if not everybody's a pedophile, then it's just the art of conversation that is just like the art of just like manipulating people by making them feel good about like the exciting stuff they're doing."
"Listen man, academics or people talk about money. I don't think academics care about money. As much as people think, what they care about is like somebody, they, they, they want to be a, it's the same thing that Instagram models posting their, but pictures is they want to be loved. They want attention and"
"They, they, and Jeff has seen the money is another way to show attention. Right. It's my work matters. And, and, and he, for some, he did that for some of the weirdest, most brilliant people. I don't want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them. It's like people that are the most interesting academics is the one he cared about. Like people are thinking about the most difficult questions of, in all of science and all of engineering. So those people are, were kind of outcasts in academia a little bit because they're doing the weird shit. They're the weirdos. And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money."
"And that, you know, that's, I don't know if there's something more nefarious than that. I, I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised. And in fact, the half, the population of the world is pedophiles."
"Signs that make you think that there's a bigger thing at play than just the man that there's some, it does look like a large organization is using this front."
"He's always the problem with that. That's probably why I hesitate to touch conspiracy theories is because I'm allergic to certainty in all forms, in politics, in any kind of discourse and people are so sure in both directions, actually, it's kind of hilarious either. They're sure that the conspiracy theory, a particular, whatever the conspiracy theories is false. Like they almost dismiss it. Like, like they, they don't even want to talk about it. It's like the people, like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat. Yes. Most scientists are like, they don't even want to like hear what the, what the flat earth is the saying. They don't have zero patience for it, which is like that maybe in that case he's deserved."
"But everything else you really like have empathy, like consider the F you have, okay, this is weird to say, but I feel like you have to consider that the earth might be flat for like one minute. Like you have to be empathetic. You have to be open-minded."
"Do you think when you go, when you dig to the core, there is a big, there's a big gap between left and right. Is there, is that division that that's perceived currently real or most people look center-left and center-right,"
"But it seems like, so that's fascinating. Conversation is different than the policies."
"So it's more, it's more just red and blue deck teams. They're arbitrary teams. Are they, so how arbitrary are these teams, I guess is another completely"
"Of imply that there's, I don't know if you're sort of in post analyzing the patterns, because it seems like there's a network effects of like, you just pick the team red or blue and it might have to do with college. You might have to do all of those things, but like, it seems like it's more about just the people around you. Correct. So less than whether you went to college or not, I mean, it's almost like, it seems like it's almost like a weird, like network effects that heart there's certain strong patterns you're identifying, but I don't know. It's sad to think that it might be just teams that have nothing to do what you actually believe."
What's wrong with that prediction.
"So this is interesting. If you could just psychoanalyze again, probably naive about this, but I'm really bothered by the hatred of liberals. It's, isn't this amorphous monster that's mocked. It's like the Shapiro, a liberal tears. And I'm also really bothered by probably more of my colleagues and friends. The hatred of Trump. Yeah. The, the Trump and, and white supremacist. So apparently 70 there's, 70 million white supremacists, 75 million, sorry."
"There's millions of white supremacists and apparently whatever liberal is. I mean, you know, literally liberal has become equivalent to white supremacist in the power of negativity at arouses. I don't even know what those, I mean, honestly, I just don't, they've become swears essentially. Is that, I mean, how do we get out of this? Because that, that's why I just don't even say anything about politics online. Cause it's like, really? Like you, you can't, you here's what happens? Anything you say that's like thoughtful, like, Hmm."
"I wonder the immigration, something like, I wonder like why, you know, we have these many, we allow these many immigrants in, or the some version of the like thinking through these difficult policies. And so they immediately tried to find like a single word in something you say that can put you in a bin of liberal or white supremacists and hammer you to death by saying you're one of the two. And then everybody just piles on happily that we finally nailed this white supremacist or liberal. And that is this some kind of weird like feature of online communication that we've just stumbled upon."
"Is there a way, or is it possible to argue that this is like a feature, not a bug? Like this is a, a good thing."
"Why? So this is everything you're saying. Makes perfect sense. Like take, yeah. It's like, it's like, again, if the aliens showed off, it's like the obvious thing to do is like, what's the popular thing. Like 80% of Americans support this, like do that clean also do it like with like grace, where you're able to bring people together, not like in a political way, but like obvious, like obvious, common sense way. Like just people, the Republicans and Democrats is bringing them together on a policy and like bold. Just hammer it without the dirt, without the mess, whatever, try to compromise."
"Just the yell with w w have a good Twitter account, like loud, very clear. We're going to give a $2,000 stimulus check. Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale. What makes America let's make America great again by manufacturing? Like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine because we're bad motherfuckers. And without maybe a more eloquent than that. And, and just do that. Why haven't we seen that for many, for several presidencies"
"Yeah. Is it also possible that the ACE students are not participating? Like we drove all the superstars away from politics. So like you just had this argument before. I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true. Like this is the obvious thing to do as a student of history, you can always like tell, like, if you look at great people in history, this is what great leaders in history, this is what they did. It's like a clean, bold action sometimes facing crisis, but we're facing a crisis."
"So why don't we, why don't we see those leaders step up? That's I mean, you say that's kind of like, it makes sense. There's a lot of different interests at play. You don't want to risk too many things on so forth, but that's what, like, that sounds like the C students."
"I didn't do anything with it, it doesn't matter. Right. He showed that it's possible. Exactly. And that, that means, that means a lot. That means you're absolutely right. There's young people right now that kind of look around and like,"
"Arguably it hasn't gone far enough almost because, but he showed this possible. And then you see other like AOC is a good example of somebody, at least in my opinion is doing the same kind of thing. But going too far in like, well, I don't know she's doing the Trump thing, but on the other side. So I don't know. What's too far who knows"
"You know,"
Yeah. There's probably thousands of people assume right now. We're just like doing a yeah.
"Yeah. And getting forever. Okay. But yeah, I mean my worst fear, I, I prefer yang, Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea exchange all that versus AOC who I think no matter what she stands for is a drama machine craze, dramas, just like Trump does. I would say my worst fear would be in 2024. Is AOC old enough? It'd be AOC versus Trump. I don't think,"
Yeah. Okay. But that kind of that's or Trump Jr.
"That's exactly what you're saying. Yes. Process grooms you over time. As you see the same thing in academia, actually, which is very interesting is the process of getting tenure. There's this it's like you're being taught without explicitly being taught to behave in the way that everybody's behaved before I've heard this. It was funny. I've had a few conversations that were deeply disappointing, which, which are, which involved statements like this is, what's good for your career. This kind of conversation, almost like mentor to mentee conversation or it's, you know, it's like, there's a grooming process in the same way."
"I guess you're saying the primary process does the same kind of thing. So I mean, that's what people have talked about with Andrew Yang. It was, it was, he was being suppressed by a bunch of different forces, the mainstream media and all just the democratic, just that whole process. Didn't didn't like the honesty that he was showing right"
"A, there's a guy people should check us out. My story is a little bit different because I basically stepped aside with the dream of being an entrepreneur earlier in the pipeline than like a, like a legitimate like senior faculty would, there's an example of somebody, if people should check out Andrew Huberman from Stanford, who was a neuroscientist who's as world-class as a guest in terms of like tenure faculty, just a really world-class researcher. And now he's doing YouTube and Instagram and he's so he switched. So he not just does Instagram. He now has a podcast and he's doing, he's changing the nature of like, I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford and for a lot, it's funny, like he's basically Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew and, and to me as well."
"And so those ripple effects and Andrews and inspiration, probably just like you're saying to these young, like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty, if we're just talking about academia and the same is probably happening with, with government is funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring a huge number of people who are saying, wait a minute, I don't have to play by the rules. Exactly. And I have to, I can think outside the box here and you're right. And the institutions we're seeing are just probably lagging behind. So the optimistic view is the future is going to be full of exciting new ideas. So Andrew Young is just kind of the beginning of this little tip of the iceberg."
"And I, and I hope that iceberg doesn't, it's not this influencer. One of the things that really bothers me. Yeah. I've gotten a chance now. I should be careful here. I don't want to, I love everybody, but you know, these people who talk about like, you know, how to make your first million or how to succeed in and they're so, I mean, yeah, that makes me a little bit cynical about, I'm worried that the people that win the game of politics will be ones that want to win the game of politics as they are. And like we mentioned, AOC is I hope they optimize for the 80% populous thing."
"Right? Like they optimize for that bad-ass thing that history will remember you as the great man, a woman that did this thing versus how do I maximize engagement today and keep growing those numbers. The influencers are so I'm so allergic to this man. They keep saying how many followers they have on the different accounts. And it's like, I don't think they understand. Maybe I don't understand. I don't really care. I think it has destructive psychological effects. One like thinking about the number, like getting excited, you're number one from a hundred to 101, and being like, and today went out to 105, Whoa, that's a big jump that maybe like thinking this way, like I wonder what I did."
"I'll do that again in this way. One it's a, it creates anxiety, almost psychological effects, whatever. The more important thing is it prevents you from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history in creatively thinking outside the box, doing huge actions. And I actually up my optimism is in the sense that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers. Well, I don't know Alexa,"
Money or attention or fame. None of that. That's not the primary priority appealing
"Yeah. I was just surprised. There's not more of them on that topic. It's now 20. What is it? 21. Yes. Let's, let's make some predictions that you can be wrong about. Good. What major political people are you thinking will run in 2024, including Trump junior, senior or Ivanka? I dunno, any Trump, Trump. And who do you think wins?"
Some prominent political figure. Was it Romney somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary few runs again. Of course
Do you think he wins after the Trump vaccine heals all of us? Do you think Trump wins depends on how popular
"And you don't think anybody else, I don't know how the process works. You don't think anybody else on the democratic side can take the, well, how could you,"
"I think you're talking about everything you're saying is correct about mediocre candidates. It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong, I don't want to use this term incorrectly, but populist somebody that speaks to the, the 80% that's is able to provide bold, eloquently described solutions that are popular. I think that breaks through all of this nonsense."
But you don't think they can tweet their way too.
"Don't you think this kind of brilliantly described the system of hate being the, the, the main mechanism of our electoral choices. Don't you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates? Like it, like it's basically the field of candidates, including Trump, including everybody was just like, didn't make anyone feel great, right? It's like, really this is what we have to choose from."
Celebrities. Right. Do you think there's some celebrities we're not even thinking about that could step in the rock
"It feels really important to us right now. Like this is the most important moment in history, but it might be okay,"
"It's funny to think. I mean, I don't want to minimize it, but like we haven't really gone through a world war two style crisis. So like say that there is a crisis in like several decades of that level, right? Existential risks to a large portion of the world, then what will be remembered as world war two, maybe a little bit about Vietnam and then whatever that crisis is. And this whole period that we see as dramatic, even coronavirus, even nine 11, it's like, cause you can look at how many people died and all those kinds of things, all the drama around the war on terror and all those kinds of things."
"Maybe Obama will be remembered for being the first African-American president, but then like that's yeah. That's fascinating to think about, Oh man, even Trump will be like, Oh, okay, cool. Yeah. Maybe he'll be remembered as the first celebrity. I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right? So like the first apolitical celebrity, that was a, so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future, they'll say that Trump was the first person to pave the way for celebrities to win. Oh man. Yeah. And yeah, I still, I still hold that this, this era will probably be remembered."
"The, you know, when people say, I talk about Elon way too much, but, but the reality is like, there's not many people that are doing the kind of things he's doing. He's why I talk about is I think this era is not necessarily Elon and space X, but this era will be remembered by the new, the, like of the space exploration of the commercial of companies getting into space, exploration of space travel. And perhaps perhaps like artificial intelligence around social media, all those kinds of things. This be remembered for that. But every, all the political bickering, all of that nonsense that might, we might, it might be very well forgotten."
"Hoping tragedy aside that this, I wish the primaries happen during coronavirus so that we, because like, then we can see the, so, okay. Here's a bunch of people facing crisis and it's an opportunity for a leader to step up. And like, I still believe the optimistic view is the game theory of like influencers will always be defeated by actual great leaders. So like maybe the great leaders are rare, but I think they're sufficiently out there that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis. And coronavirus is, is obviously a crisis where like, you know, mass manufacturer of tests, all, all kinds of infrastructure building they could have done in 2020."
"There's so many possibilities for just like bold action. And none of that, even just forget actually doing the action, advocating for it saying like this, we need, we need to do this. And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made, I don't even remember a single speech that Biden made because there's zero bold. I mean their strategy was to be quiet and let Donald Trump polarize the electorate, polarize the electorate and hope that results in, in them winning because of the high unemployment numbers and all those kinds of things, as opposed to like, let's go big, let's go with a big speech."
"You know that, ah, yeah, it's a loss lost opportunities in some sense. So we talked a bunch about politics, but one of the other interesting things is that you're involved with is or involved with defining the future of as journalism. I suppose you can think of podcasts as the kind of journalism, but also just writing in general and just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like is up to be defined by people like you. So what do you think is broken about journalism and what do you think is the future of journalism?"
It like Instagram almost even Twitter.
"But not only that I don't know about you, but I also looked at Twitter to the exact thing you're saying, which is the response to the news, right? The thoughtful sounds ridiculous, but you can be pretty thoughtful in a single tweet. If you,"
Do you think unfettered conversations have a chance to win this battle?
"The platform. Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism, but you know, a New York times is still, and I don't think I'm speaking about a particular sector. I think it, as a brand, it is, it does have the level of credibility assigned to it still, you know, there's politicization of it. Totally. But it there's a credibility. Like it has much more credibility than forgive me, but then I think you and I have no you're right. In terms of your podcasts, like people are not going to be like, they're going to say it the New York times versus what you said on a podcast for, for an opinion, that I wonder in the sense of battles, whether unfettered conversations with the Joe Rogan, whether your podcast can become the half of the same level of legitimacy or the, the flip side, New York times loses legitimacy to be at the same level of, in terms of how we talk about it."
"Yeah. Okay. Maybe I'm just a hater because I love podcasting from the beginning. I love green day before the repairable man, but I am bothered by it. Like why doesn't Kara Swisher? She's done successfully. I think. Oh no. She was always a part of some kind of institution. I'm not sure"
I don't know if that's her own thing. Yeah. Yeah. So she was very successful there. Why the hell did she join? The New York times was the new podcast. Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing because he gets
"Sad to me because it propagates old thinking like, you know, it propagates old institutions and you could say the New York times is going to evolve quickly and so on. But I would love it if there was a mechanism for re-establishing like for building new, New York times in terms of public legitimacy. And I suppose that's a wishful thinking because it takes time to build trust in institutions and it takes time to build new things."
"Yeah. And the cool thing. He also supports that ecosystem. He's such a, it's so generous. One of the things he paved the way on for me is to show that you can just be honest, publicly honest and not jealous of other people's success, but instead of be supportive and, and all those kinds of things, just like loving"
"Towards others, he's been an inspiration. I mean, to the comic community, I think there are a bunch of before that, I think there were all a bunch of competitive haters."
"We're still like many are still resistant, but they're like, they can't help it. Cause he's such a huge voice. He like forces them to be like loving towards each other. And the same, I try to, one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast was to try to, I wanted to be like, do what Joe Rogan did, but for the scientific community, like my little circle of scientific community of like, like let's support each other. Yeah."
"Just by the way, in terms of deep state and shadow government, Ivy lo has to do with aliens. You better believe Joe"
"This is awesome. I just wish both the American airlines, FBI and government would be more transparently. There'll be voices. And I know it sounds ridiculous, but the kind of transparency you see, maybe not Joe Rogan he's, he's like overly transparent is just the comic relief, but just, I don't know, a podcast"
"From the FBI, just like being honest, like excited, confused. I'm sure the co they're being overly cautious about their release information. I'm sure there's a lot of information that would inspire the public that it inspire trust in institutions that will not damage national security. Like it seems to me obvious and the reason they're not sharing it is because of the momentum of bureaucracy of caution and so on. But there's probably so much cool information that the government has the way I almost,"
"So he might be afraid. That's what I mean though. He's they would probably all tell him like, sir, you can't do this, you know, all this."
Is that real? What does that apply to bullshit. Bullshit.
"Chief of staff. Well, there's a whole bureaucracy, but just like you were saying with intent, you have to be like, that has to be your focus because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy for probably for a good reason. So to get through to the information, there's a whole like paperwork process, all that kind of stuff. You can't just walk in and get the, unless again, with intention that becomes your thing. Like let's revolutionize this thing. And then you get only so many things that it's, it's sad that the bureaucracy has, has gotten so bulky. But I think the hopeful messages from earlier in our conversation, it seems like a single person can't fix it. But if you hire the right team, it feels like you can can't fix everything."
I don't want him.
"I hope they were real with each other. And there was like a genuine human connection, right? That I, that seems Johnson. Wasn't a genuine guy. I knew we'd need to read those thousands of pages. I've been way too focused on Hitler."
Power. Exactly. That's
"But there's fewer evil people there. Yes, but well, but th that's what actually,"
Blur you can't talk about world war II without world war one.
"And he has it, how it works. Exactly it it's, it's kind of interesting. You're making me realize that world war II is one of the rare Wars where you can make a strong case for it's a fight of good versus evil war theory. Obviously like they literally slaughtering Jews, like, you know, we have to kill them and there's one person doing it. I mean, there's one person at the core there's it's yeah. That's fascinating. And it's short and there's a clear aggression. It's interesting that Dan Carlin has been avoiding Hitler as well. Yeah, probably for this reason. I probably think this reason, I mean, it's, it's complicated too, right? Because there's a pressure that guy has his demons."
"I loved it so much. So this is the, the, I don't know if you feel this pressure, but as a creative, he feels the pressure of being maybe not necessarily correct, but maybe correct. In the, in the sense that his understanding he gets to the bottom of, of why something happened of what really happened. Yeah. Did get to the bottom of it before he can say something publicly about it. And he is a torture by that burden. I now he, you know, he takes so much shit from historical community for no reason. I think he's the greatest popularizer quote unquote of history."
"And I wish more people in history understood it that way. He was an inspiration to me. I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram now where I'll like, I'll do like a book tour. I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents. And like, here's what I learned from this book and this book and this, and that was very much like a, a skill I learned from him of being like, as you know, as a historian. Right?"
"Spires me, man. Yeah. He really does to like learn more and I've read, I bought a lot of books because of Dan Carlin. He'll be, you know, because of this guy, because of that guy, in terms of, you know, another thing he does, which nobody else, and I'm probably guilty of this, he focuses on the actual people involved. Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers in world war one. And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too. We over-focus on what was happening in the German general staff, what was happening in the British general staff. And he doesn't make that mistake. That's why he tells real history. Yeah. And, and maybe it gives it a feeling. The result is that there's a feeling, you get the feeling of what it was like to be the Zack, you know, you're becoming quickly becoming more and more popular speaking about political issues in part, do you feel a burden, like almost like the, the prison of your prior convictions of having being popular with a certain kind of audience and thereby unable to really think outside the box I had, I've, I've really struggled with this."
"This is probably one of the first political, liberal politics related conversations we've had. I mean, unless you count Michael malice, who I, he's the funny guy, he's not so much political as he is like burning down, man."
"For me. Yeah. I, I think he's a place for that. It's almost well, first of all, he's a, he's working on a new book, which I really appreciate outside of the, he's working on like a big book for awhile, which is white pill. There's also working on this like short little thing, which is a like anarchists handbook or something like that. Yeah. It's like anarchy for idiots or something like that, which I think is really well, me being an idiot and being curious about anarchy, it seems useful. So I like those kinds of books. That's Russian"
"Yeah. I it's. I find those kinds of things, a useful thought experiment because that's why I didn't, it's, it's frustrating to me when people talk about communism and socialism or even capitalism where they can't enjoy the thought experiment of like, why did communism fail and maybe ask the question of like, are there, is it possible to make communism succeed or are there good ideas and communism, like, I enjoy the thought experiment. Like the, the discourse of it, like though the reasoning and like devil's advocate and all that people have like seem to not have patience for that. They're like commies and bad."
Right.
That is true. But there were also a series of
It's fascinating to think that there could have been a history of the Soviet union that was dramatically different than Leninism Stalinism. That was completely different. Like almost it will be the American story.
"He still talks to this day. Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like, do you want to return to the nineties? Right? Do you want to return it"
"I, I, it's very difficult for me to understand. I've been hanging out thanks to clubhouse. A lot of I've gotten to learn a lot about the Nevani folks and it's been very educational made me ask a lot of important questions about what, you know, questioned a lot of my assumptions about what I do and don't know, but I'll just say that I do believe, you know, there's a lot of the Nevani folks say that Putin is in competent and as a, as a bad executive, like is bad basically running government, but to me,"
"Right. Yeah. They would say the control. There is a strong either control or pressure on the press. But I think there is a legitimate support and love of Putin and Russia that is not grounded in just misinformation and propaganda. There's there's legitimacy there. Mostly I tried to remain apolitical and actually genuinely remain apolitical. I am legitimately not interested in the politics of Russia of today. I feel I have some responsibility and I'll take that responsibility on as I need to. But my fascination, as it is, perhaps with you in part is in the historical figure of Putin. I know he's currently president, but I'm almost looking like as if I was a kid in 30 years from now reading about him, studying the human being, the, the games of power that are played, that got them to gain power, to maintain power."
"What that says about his human nature, the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him, the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things, as opposed to the politics and the manipulation and the corruption and the control of the media, that results in misinformation, you know, those, those are the bickering of the day, just like or saying what will actually be remembered about this moment in history."
"60. So he would be, I think he would be 80. So with, with the change of the constitution, he cannot"
"Be president until six, four, 2034. I think it is. So he will be like 80 something and he'll be in power for over 30 years, which is longer than stalling. So, but he's still, he still seems to be, seems fit. I think"
"Question that you ask, which is like, what does he want? I don't know. Yeah. That's the quite I don't"
"It makes me wonder, well, looking at some of the biggest leaders in human history to ask the question of what was the motivation, what was the motivation for even just the revolutionaries, like Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin? What was the motivation? Because it's sure as hell seems like the motivation was at least in part, the driven by the idea by ideas, not self interest of like power"
"And maybe it became a useful propaganda tool, but it still seemed like he believed in it, whether it was of course this, the question, I mean, this is a problem with conspiracy theories for me. And this is legitimate criticism towards me about conspiracy theories, which is, you know, just because you're not like this doesn't mean others, not like this. So like, I can't believe that somebody be like deeply two faced. I met them"
"I would be able to detect like, no, well, this my question is, well, so there's differences just to face like there's different levels of to face. Like what I mean is to be killing people. And it's like house of cards, style, right. And, and still present a front, like you're like, you're not killing people. I don't know if it's, I guess it's possible, but I just don't see that at scale. Like there's a lot of people like that and I don't have trouble imagining some, you know, that's such a compelling narrative that people like to say, like people that's the conspiratorial mindset."
"I think that skepticism, resilient, powerful, and important to have because it's true. A lot of powerful people abuse their power. But saying that I bottle, I feel like people over assume that it's like, I see that with a use of steroids often in sports, people seem to make that claim about like everybody who's successful. And I want to be very, I don't know something about me wants to be cautious because I want to give people a chance."
"Yeah. But at the same time, being naive, really optimistic about everything is also a kind of <inaudible> people are going to fuck you over. And more importantly, that doesn't bother me more importantly, you're not going to be able to reason about how'd you create systems that are going to be robust to corruption, to a malevolent like parties. So in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance of both, I suppose, especially if you want to actually engineer things that, that work in this world that has evil in it. Right. I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on desk. We've mentioned a lot of books throughout this conversation. I wonder. And this makes me really curious to explore in a lot of depth, the kind of books that you're interested in."
"I think you mentioned your show that you, you provide recommendations. Yes I do. In the form of spoken word, can you be on what we've already recommended, mentioned books, whether it is historical nonfiction or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction that had a big impact on your life. There, is there a few that you can mention? Sure."
Okay. Can I ask you a question about those books? Yes. What the hell do you fit into so many pages? Everything.
"First of all, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to take this part of the pocket. I'm gonna set it to music when I listen to it. Cause I've been whining and bitching about running 40 miles of Goggins this next weekend. And this is, this is gonna be so easy. I'm just going to listen to this over and over in my head, you're"
About them all the time he uses. I was going
"To ask you about the use as an example of that is a as an example of what Mars colonization,"
"Like, what is it? Is it like simulating the experience of what it would be like?"
"Absolutely history remembers the ones who didn't eat each other. Yeah. We re well, yeah, we remember the ones. Yeah."
"The story of Mars as well will be the story far. So, but nevertheless, that's the interesting thing about on target. Nevertheless, something about human nature drives us to explore it. Yes. And that seems to be like, you know, a lot of people have this kind"
"Of, to me, frustrating conversations like, well, earth is great, man. Why do we need to call them as Mars? Like you just don't get it. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. It's the same people that say like, why are you running? Like, why are you running a marathon? What are you running from, man? I don't know. It's pushing the limits of the, of the human mind of the, of what's possible Mallory because it's there. Yeah. Simple. And that, and that's somehow actually the result of that, if you want to be pragmatic about it, there's something about pushing that limit that has side-effects that you don't expect that will create a better world back home for the people, not necessarily on earth, but like just in general, it raises the quality of life for everybody, even though the initial endeavor doesn't make any sense."
"The very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible then has side effects of benefiting everybody. And it's difficult to predict ahead of time or what those benefits will be say with colonizing Mars. It's unclear what the benefits will be for earth or in general,"
That's how I would put it. He should run for president.
"Doing difficult things and pushing, exploring the world in all of its forms. I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics to that same kind of, well, it can,"
"And I hope so. I don't know if you want to stay on it, but I think that was book number one or two shit. All right. Is there"
"I agree with you a hundred percent. I I'm ashamed to, I usually don't bring up sapiens because it's like, yeah, it's like, uncle's rented, but yeah, that's a good thing. It is one of the, I think it will be remembered as one of the great books of this particular era. Yeah. Because it's, it's so clearly it's like the selfish gene with Dockers. I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together and puts language to it. That's makes it very useful to talk about. So it is one of the great books."
"Which is that I'm just going to listen to this whole podcast next week. You got to,"
"You found us somehow to, to our true nature. Yeah."
"Yeah. Not, I wouldn't be very good at it, but like, I'm so glad that somebody that who thinks deeply about politics is so fascinated with exploration and with the very basic nature, like human nature, nature of our existence. I love that. There's something in you and still you're stuck in DC for now, for now. Speaking of which the you're from Texas. Yes. What do you make of the future of Texas politically, culturally, economically. I am in part moving well, I'm moving to Austin grass, but I'm also doing the Eric Weinstein advice, which is like, dude, you're not married."
You don't have kids. There's no such thing as moving.
"You're like, like your three suits and some shirts and underwear. What exactly is the move entail? So I have nothing. So I'm basically, you know, it's very, just remain mobile, but there's a promise. There's a hope to Austin outside of, I mean, my outside of just like friendships, I have no, it's a very different culture that Joe Rogan is creating. I'm mostly interested in the what the next Silicon Valley will be, what the next hub of technological innovation. And there's a promise, maybe a dream for Austin being the next place that possible. It doesn't have the baggage of some of the political things."
"Maybe some of the sort of things that hold back. The beauty of that makes capitalism that makes innovation so powerful, which is like a meritocracy, which is excellence. Diversity is exceptionally important, but not, it should not be the only priority. It has to be something that it co-exists with, like insatiable drive towards excellence. And it seems like Texas is a nice place like having Austin, which is like a kind of this weird. I hope it stays weird, man. I love weird people."
"We can get it, but it's, there's this hope is it remains this weird place of brilliant innovation. It's the, a state that's like more conserved. So like there's a nice balance of everything. What are your thoughts about the future of Texas?"
"Joe, I'm going to say,"
"You're ultimately another human being than the one who left Texas. Yeah. So, I mean, have you actually considered moving to Texas and broadly just outside of your own story, what do you think is the future of Texas was a feature of Austin? Yes. There's so much transformation seemingly happening now related to Silicon Valley, live California"
"Perspective. Well, first of all, I love some of the, the cowboy things that Texas stands for more practically, from my perspective, the injection of the tech innovation, right. That's moving to Texas has made it very exciting to me. It seems like outside of all that maybe you can speak to the weird in Austin. It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich sort of almost like mainstream at this point. Right. But he's also attracting a lot of weirdos and so Ilan and a lot of those weirdos of my friends and they're like, like Michael malice, like those weirdos."
"And it's like, I have a hope for Austin that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos will get injected."
Money on the entertainment. Exactly. You
"But no matter what, you know, a new place allows the possibility for new ideas, even if they're somehow left-leaning and all those kinds of things. I do think the only two things missing from Austin and Texas are a two dudes in a suit that sometimes have a podcast talk a bunch of nonsense and a mic. So let's, let's bring the best suit game to"
"The following is a conversation with Ronald Sullivan, a professor at Harvard law school known for taking on difficult and controversial cases. He was on the head legal defense team for the Patriots football player, Aaron Hernandez, and his double murder case. He represented one of the genus six defendants and never lost the case during his years in Washington, DC's public defender services office in 2019, Ronald joined the legal defense team of Harvey Weinstein, a film producer facing multiple charges of rape and other sexual assault. This decision met with criticism from Harvard university students, including an online petition by students seeking his removal as faculty Dean, a winter palace, then a letter supporting him signed by 52 Harvard law school."
"Professors appeared in the Boston globe on March 8th, 2019. Following this the Harvard administration succumbed to the pressure of a few Harvard students and announced that they will not be renewing Ronald solvent Dean position. This created a major backlash in the public discourse over the necessary role of universities in upholding the principles of law and freedom at the very foundation of the United States. This conversation is brought to you by Brooklyn and sheets, wine access, online wine store, monk pack, low carb snacks and Blinkist app that summarizes books click their links to support this podcast."
"As a side note, let me say that the free exchange of difficult ideas is the only mechanism through which we can make progress. Truth is not a safe space. Truth is humbling and being humbled can hurt, but this is the role of education, not just in the university, but in business and in life. Freedom and compassion can coexist, but it requires work and patience. It requires listening to the voices and to the experiences, unlike our own listening, not silencing, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and no ads in the middle. I tried to have fun with these, even though my voice is genetically incapable of sounding like I'm having fun."

This episode is sponsored by booklet and sheets. I am not an expert on comfort. I've often throughout my life, slept on the carpet without anything but a jacket and jeans, but these sheets have been amazing in general. For many years, I've mostly lived a minimus life in the things that eat in the content I consume in the possessions that actually have material possessions in the things that have hung up on my wall, which is usually nothing except maybe a picture of firemen and Einstein."
"And when you have a minimalist life like that, you could really appreciate quality. I think there's two kinds of products. Of course, it's a Venn diagram, but the first category is the ones you get to show to the world. And the other is the ones you get to make yourself feel happy like internally intrinsic versus extrinsic. I guess again, it's probably a significant overlap, but I do appreciate quality. I do appreciate products that make me feel good. These sheets are that. So it's nice. I will never be dependent on these things. If I do feel myself becoming dependent, I will let go of them."

"I personally had a lot of joyful experiences drinking wine because at least for me, one has been a thing that brings close friends and family together over a great meal. So I kind of think there's several categories of alcohol. Wine is like a ball sharing love with friends. And then there's like the other side of the spectrum, which is tequila, where every single experience of had or tequila was involved. I've regretted. So if you choose wine, it's choosing love. If you choosing tequila, you're choosing danger, but sometimes a little dangerous, fun. So, but most of the time you want to stick with wine. You want to stick with wine access."

"And there are only 140 calories. It's actually interesting to think about what kind of fuel is needed when you're on the low carb diet, when you all of a sudden step up the performance needs. So like, if I usually run, you know, five or six miles here and there do a few pushups and pull-ups and so on, if I all of a sudden have to run like an ultra marathon, which I hope I don't have to, but I very well might need to. Once I meet David, there's quite a few people that say you can do the ultra on continuing low carb, like ultra low carb, but there's also a lot of people that say, well, no, in these cases, even if you eat low carb, you need to load up on carbs, all that stuff."
"There's so many debates. There's so confusing. I don't know what to make of it. I think I go back to the same thing I would go back to, which is you have to experiment on yourself and you have to listen to your body.

"Lex. This episode is also supported by Blinkus my favorite app for learning new things. Blink is takes the key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them down into just 15 minutes they can read or listen to. They've also started doing this weirdly amazing thing called short casts, which summarizes podcasts. They have like a selection of podcasts and they summarize them. The ones they choose. They're like the really well organized podcasts, but it's kind of fun to think about them trying to summarize like this podcast that I'm doing, or even like the crazier long form podcast, like a Joe Rogan experience, kind of buckets. Good luck trying to summarize that chimps, DMT and aliens."
"There you go. That's a summary. I should work for Blinkist. I really actually enjoy this idea of hardcore summarization. Like some people listen to podcasts like two weeks or even more faster. Like there's a lot of value to that. Or even just like with Blinkist summarizing books that are like huge into just like a few pages. I really think that's exceptionally valuable, but it also has to be coupled with actually reading long form content or listening to long form content as well. And I actually think there's space to listening to stuff at like one X and pausing and giving your mind a chance to think. I really think there's power in silence."
"You know, you can call the boredom or whatever, but it's that meditative silence that you want to escape. There's an anxious desire to escape that silence. But if you resist that anxious desire, I brilliant ideas"
"Come. So that's the value of long form content. But then the short form content is really valuable because you get condensed information. So you're maximizing on information with long form content you're maximizing on the silence and the chance to think anyway, go to blinkist.com/lex to start your free seven day trial and get 25% off of Blinkist premium membership.

"We're one of the lawyers who represented the Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein in advance of a sexual assault trial for this Harvard forced you to step down as faculty deans, you and your wife, winter palace. Can you tell the story of this saga from first deciding to represent Harvey Weinstein to the interesting complicated events that followed?"
"Is there a philosophy behind you taken on these very difficult cases? Like, is it a set of principles? Is it just your love of the law or is it, is there a set of principles? Why you take on the case?"
"As from a psychological perspective, just you as a human. Is there, is there a fear, is there a stress from all the pressure? Cause if you're facing, I mean the whole point, a difficult case, especially in the latter that you mentioned of the going against popular opinion, you have the eyes of millions potentially looking at you with anger, as you try to defend, you know, this, these set of laws that this country is built on."
"So one of the hardest cases of recent history would be the Harvey Weinstein in terms of popular opinion or unpopular opinion. So, well, if you continue on that line or what was that, where does that story take you of taking on this case?"
Teach teaching moment. Yeah. Very important teaching moment. So they they've forced you to step down from that faculty Dean position at the house.
"Day, release it, release"
"That seems like a Seminole mistake by Harvard and Harvard is one of the great universities in the world. And so sort of its successes and its mistakes are really important for the world as a beacon of like what, how we make progress. So what lessons for the bigger academia they get, that's under fire a lot, these days of what bigger lessons do take away. Like how do we make Harvard great. How do we make other universities, Yale, MIT, great in the face of such mistakes?"
"So, I mean, what does it kind of boils down to is just having difficult conversation, difficult debates when you mentioned a sort of 19 year olds, and it's funny, I've seen this even at MIT. It's not that they shouldn't have a voice. It should sh they,"
"They do seem to, I guess you have to experience it and just observe it. They have a strangely disproportionate power, right. It's very interesting to, to basically, I mean, you say, yes, there's great faculty and so on, but you know, it's not even just that the faculty is smart or wise or whatever, it's that they're just silenced. So the terminology that you mentioned is weaponized as a sort of safe spaces or that certain conversations make people feel unsafe. What do you think about this kind of idea, you know, is, is, is there some things that are unsafe to talk about in a university setting?"
"Is there a lines to be drawn somewhere? And just like you said, on the flip side with a slippery slope, is it too easy for the lines to be drawn everywhere?"
"And I, I think there needs to be a mechanism outside of the space of ideas of humbling. I got, I've done martial arts for a long time. I got my ass kicked a lot. I think that's really important. I mean, the, in the space of ideas, I mean, even just in engineering, just all the math classes, my memories of math, which I love is it's kind of pain is basically coming face-to-face with the F with the idea that I'm not special, that I'm much dumber than I thought I was. And that anything accomplishing anything in this world requires really hard work."
"That's really humbling that makes you that, that puts you. Cause I remember when I was 18 and 19 and I thought I was going to be the smartest, the best fighter, the Nobel prize, winning, you know, all those kinds of things. And then you come with the face to face with the reality and it hurts. And it feels like there needs to be efficient mechanisms from the best universities in the world did without abusing"
"You. It's a very difficult line to walk without like mentally or physically abusing you be able to humble you. And that's what I felt was missing in these very difficult, very important conversations is the 19 year olds when they spoke up the mechanism for humbling, them with ideas was missing. I got kind of gotten broken, broken down because as you say, there does, like I sensed fear. Every everything was permeated with fear and fear is a paralyzing fear as destructive, especially in a place that's supposed to be all about freedom of ideas."
"Right? And I mean, I don't know if you have anything and you thoughts to say on this whole idea of cancel culture, where people, I mean, a lot of people use is become political. So say maybe outside of the world to politics, is this, do you have, do you have thoughts about it? Does it bother you that people are sort of put in this bin and labeled as something and then thereby you can ignore everything they say and you Steven Pinker, there's a lot of Harvard folks that are fighting against, I guess, these set of ideas. But do you have, do you have thoughts?"
"In some sense, you're an inspiration that you're able to withstand the pressure, the pressure of the masses, but it is, is it's a sad, it's a sad aspect of human nature that we kind of get into these crowds and we get, we start chanting and it's fun for some reason. And then you forget yourself and then you sort of wake up the next day, not, not having anticipated the consequences of all the chanting and we will get ourselves in trouble in that. I mean, there's some responsibility on the, on social networks and the mechanisms by which they make it more frictionless to do the chanting, to do the canceling, to do the outrage and all that kind of stuff."
"So I actually on the technology side have a hope that that's fixable, but yeah, it does seem to be a w you know, it almost like the internet showed to us that we have a lot of broken ways about which we communicate with each other. And we're trying to figure that out. Same with the university, the, this mistake by Harvard showed that we need to reinvent what the university is. And I mean, all of this is it's almost like we're finding our baby deer legs and trying to strengthen the institutions that have been very successful for, for, for a long time. You know, the really interesting thing was Harvey Weinstein."
"And you choosing these exceptionally difficult cases is also thinking about what it means to defend evil people. What it means to defend these could say unpopular, and you might push back against the word word, evil, but bad people in society. First of all, do you think there's such a thing as evil, or do you think all people are good and it's just circumstances that create evil and also is there somebody to evil for the law to defend?"
Is it genetic or is it the circumstance like w w what kind of work does it do for you intellectually?
"You still put a responsibility for the, on the individual."
"Wow. That's so powerful. The constellation of bad choices, that's such a powerful way to think about sort of equality, which is the, the set of trajectories before you, that you could take, if you just roll. The dice is, you know, life has, is a kind of optimization problem. Sorry to take us into math over a set of trajectories, under imperfect information. So you're going to do a lot of stupid shit to put it in technical terms, but the, the fraction of the trajectories that take you into, into bad places or into good places is really important."
"And that's ultimately what we're talking about. An evil might be just a little bit of a predisposition biologically, but the rest is just trajectories that you can take. I miss studying Hitler a lot recently, I've been reading probably way too much. And it's, it's interesting to think about all the possible trajectories, right? That could have avoided the, this particular individual developing the hate that he did to following that he did the, the actual final. There's a few turns in him, psychologically, where he went from being a leader that just wants to conquer and to somebody who allowed his anger and emotion to take over joy, he started making mistakes for, in terms of militarily speaking, but also started doing, you know, evil things and all the possible trajectories that could have avoided that are fascinating, including he wasn't that bad at painting at a drawing."
"And it's time at Vianna. There's all these possible things to think about. And of course, as millions of others like him, that never came to power and all those kinds of things. So, but that goes to the second question on the, on the side of evil, do you think, and, and Hitler's often brought up as like an example of somebody who is like, they pin me of evil. Do you think you would, if you got that same phone call after world war II and Hitler survived during war, you know, the trial for war crimes, would you take the case defending Adolfo Hitler, if you don't want to answer that one, is there a line to draw for evil for who to not to defend?"
"That is a beautiful, ideal is difficult to think about it in the face of public pressure. It's just, I mean, it's of terrifying"
"To watch the masses during this past year of 2020 to wash the power of the masses, to make a decision before any of the data is out. If the data is ever out and you have the details and you have the processes and I, and there is an anger to the justice system. There's a lot of people that feel like, even though the ideal you describe is a beautiful one. It does not always operate justly. It does not operate to the best of its ideals. It operates unfairly. Can we go to the big picture of the criminal justice system?"
What do you given the ideal works about our criminal justice system and what is broken?
"Oh, to, to make it more efficient, to make judgements. So the racism makes it more efficient."
"Well, let me ask in terms of the innocence. So you've gotten a lot of people who are innocent, a U D I G I guess, revealed their innocence, demonstrated their innocence. What's that process like? What's it like emotionally, psychologically, what's it like legally to fight the system in, through the process of revealing sort of the innocence of a human being"
Do you think it's possible to eradicate racism from the judicial system?
"I think it's kind of fascinating if you look throughout history and race is just part of that is we create the other and treat the other with disdain. So the legal system, but just the human nature. I tend to believe we mentioned offline that I work with robots. It sounds absurd to say, especially to you, especially because we're talking about racism and it's so prevalent today, I do believe that there will be almost like a civil rights movement for robots, because with, I think there's a huge value to society of having artificial intelligence systems that are, that interact with humans at our, and our human, like, and the more they become human-like, you will, they will start, they will start to ask very fundamentally human questions about freedom, about suffering, about justice."
"And there will we'll have to come face to face, like look in the mirror in asking the question, just because we're biologically based, just because we're sort of, well, just because we're human, does that mean we're the only ones that deserve the rights again, giving, forming another other group, which is robots. And I'm sure there could be along that path, different versions of other that we form. So racism, race is certainly a big other that we've made, as you said, a lot of progress on throughout the history of this country, but it does feel like we always create, as we make progress, create new other groups."
"And of course the other, the other group that perhaps is outside the legal system that people talk about is the essential. Now I eat a lot of meat, but the torture of animals, you know, that people talk about when we look back from, you know, a couple of centuries from now, look back at the kind of things we're doing to animals. We might regret that we might see that in a very different light. And it's kind of interesting to see the future trajectory of what we wake up to about the injustice in our, in our ways. But the robot one is the one I'm especially focused on cause, but at this moment in time, it seems ridiculous, but I'm sure most civil rights movements throughout history seem ridiculous at first."
"Or a great journal intelligence, all those kinds of things. Yeah. A huge amount of progress has been made and there it's fascinating to watch. So I'm, I'm, I'm on both minds as a person who's building them. I'm realizing how sort of quote, unquote dumb they are, but also looking at human history and how poor we are predicting the progress of innovation and technology. It's obvious that we have to be humble by our ability to predict coupled with the fact that we keep, do you use terminology carefully here, we keep discriminating against the intelligence of artificial systems, the smarter they get, the more ways we find to dismiss the, their intelligence."
"So this, this has just been going on throughout where I it's almost as if we're threatened in the most primitive human way, animalistic way, we're threatened by the power of other creatures. And we want to lessen dismiss them. So consciousness is a really important one, but the one I think about a lot in terms of consciousness, the very engineering question is whether the display of consciousness is the same as the possession of consciousness. So if a robot tells you, they are cautious, if a robot looks like they're suffering, when you torture them, if a robot is afraid of death and says, they're afraid of death and are legitimately afraid, like for, in terms of just everything we, as humans use to determine the ability of somebody to be their own entity."
"They're the one that loves one, that fears one that hopes one that can suffer. If, if a robot like in the dumbest of ways is able to display that we, it, it changes. It starts changing things very quickly. I'm not sure what it is, but it does seem that there's a huge component to consciousness. That is a social creation. Like we together create our consciousness. Like we believe our common humanity together, alone. We wouldn't be aware of our humanity and the law as it protects. Our freedoms seems to be a construct of the social construct."
"And when you add other creatures into it, it's not obvious to me that like you have to build, there'll be a moment when you say this thing is now cautious. I think there's going to be a lot of fake it until you make it. And there'll be a very gray area between fake and make that is going to force us to contend w w what it means to be an entity that deserves rights. We're all, all men are created equal. The, the men part might have to expand in ways that we are not yet anticipating. And it's very interesting. I mean, my favorite, the fundamental thing I love about artificial intelligence, does it get smarter and smarter?"
"It challenges to think of what is right. The questions of justice, questions of freedom. It basically challenges us to, to understand our own mind, to understand what, like, almost from an engineering first principles perspective, to understand what it is that makes us human. That is at the core of all the rights that we talk about and all the documents we write. So even if we don't give rights artificial intelligence systems, we may be able to construct more fair legal systems to protect us humans."
"And so, yeah, the soul, the soul is a fun one. There's no soul. I'm not sure maybe you can correct me, but there's very few discussion of soul in our legal system. Right? Right. Correct."
"So if we can dive into, we've already been doing it both, we can dive into more difficult territory. So 2020 had the tragic case of George Floyd. When you reflect on the protests on the racial tensions, over the death of George Floyd, how do you make sense of it all? What do you take away from these events?"
"But with the millions of people protesting, there is nevertheless taken us back to the most difficult of trials. You have the trial, like you mentioned, that's going on now, Derek showing of one of the police officers involved. What are your thoughts? What are your predictions on this trial? Where the law, the process of the law is trying to proceed in the face of so much racial tension yet"
"Sorry to take a, sorry to interrupt. But so one of the interesting qualities of this trial, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the cameras are allowed in the courtroom, at least during the jury selection. So, so you get to watch some of this stuff. And the other part is the jury selection. Again, I'm very inexperienced, but it seems like selecting in what is it? Unbiased jury is really difficult for this trial. It's it almost like I, I don't know me as a listener, like, listen, you know, listening to people that are trying to talk their way into the jury kind of thing, trying to decide is this person really unbiased?"
"Are they just trying to hold on to their like deeply held emotions and trying to get onto the jury? I mean, it's incredibly difficult process. I don't know if you can comment on a case so difficult, like the ones you've mentioned before, how do you select a jury that represents the people and doesn't and carries the sort of the ideal of the law?"
"An interesting question. And I apologize. I haven't watched a lot, cause it is very long. I I've watched it. You know, there's, there's certain questions you've asked in the jury, you asked the jury selection. I remember I think one jumped out at me, which is, you know, something like does the fact that this person is a police officer make you feel any kind of way about them. So trying to get at that, you know, I don't know what that is. I guess that's bias. And it's such a difficult question to ask. Like I asked myself that question, like how much, you know, we all kinda want to pretend that we're not racist."
"We're known to judge. We don't have, we're like, these were the reasonable human, but you know, legitimately asking yourself, like, are you, what are the, what are the prejudgments you have in your mind? Is that even impossible for a human being? Like when you look at yourself in the mirror and think about it, is it possible to actually answer that?"
"Well, that's, that's fascinating that, especially the way you're inspiring, the way you're speaking now is, I mean, I guess you're calling on the jury. That's kind of the whole system is you calling on the jury, each individual on the jury to step up and really think, you know, to, to step up and be their most thoughtful selves, actually, most introspective, like you're trying to basically ask people to be their best selves and that's, and they, I guess a lot of people step up to that."
"So what do you think happens? I mean, maybe I, I'm not so much on the legal side of things, but on the social side, it's like what the OJ Simpson trial do you think it's possible that Derek Showen does not get convicted of the, what is it, second degree murder. How do you think about that? How do you think about the potential social impact of that? The, the riots, the protest of either, either direction, any words that are said the tension here, it could be explosive, especially with the cameras."
"Yeah. I'm not sure what's worse, but yeah."
"Well, there could be a set. Is there also a potential tensions that could arise from the sentencing? I don't know how that exactly works. Sort of not enough years kind of thing. Yeah. It could be like all that kind of stuff"
"I feel like with the judge and the lawyers, there's an opportunity to have really important, long lasting speeches. I don't know if they think of it that way, especially with the cameras, it feels like they have the capacity to heal or to divide. Do you ever think about that as a, as a lawyer, as a legal mind, that your words aren't just about the case, but I bought the reverberate through history potentially."
"What would he make? What do you make of the adjacencies and trial? Do you have thoughts about it? He's, he's out in Nevada and on social media. Now who's a public figure. Is there a lessons to be drawn from that whole saga?"
"Do you think about, do you think about representations of storytelling like you yourself in your role?"
"And of course you can do the ultra dramatic, the glove doesn't fit kind of the climax and all those kinds of things. Yes. But that's the best of narratives, the best of stories. Yes. Speaking of other really powerful stories that you're involved with is the Aaron Hernandez trial and the whole story, the whole legal case. Can you maybe overview the big picture story and legal case of Aaron Hernandez?"
"Okay. So that, that sets the context. What was your involvement in this case? Like legally, intellectually, psychologically when this particular second charge of murder?"
"What was he like? Well, in that time, what was he worn down by the whole process was there. So he was, he lightened."
"Mind and body,"
"But there seemed to be like an innocent stone in terms of just the way he saw the world. I picked that up from the, from the documentary, just taking"
So there is a Netflix documentary titled killer inside the mind of Aaron Hernandez. What are your thoughts on this documentary? I don't know if you've gotten a chance.
"Watch. Huh. Is that, does that apply to most of your work? Do you try to stay away from the way the press perceives stuff"
"And even if you think you can ignore it, just reading it, we'll have a little bit of an effect on your mind. I think that over time I might accumulate. So the, the documentary, but in general, it mentioned, or kind of emphasized and talked about Aaron's sexuality or sort of there were discussing basically the idea that he was a homosexual and some of the trauma, some of the suffering that he endured in his life had to do with sort of fear given this society of, of what his father would think of, what others around him sort of, especially in, in sport culture and football and so on."
"So I don't know in your interaction with him was, do you think that maybe even leaning up to a suicide, do you think his struggle with coming to terms with this sexuality had a role to play in much of his difficulties?"
"When you look back at that at, at his story, does it make you sad?"
"Yeah. And, and I mean, just on the human side, of course we don't know the full story, but just everything that led up to suicide, everything led up to an incredible professional football player. You know, that whole story, if"
"And it's, it has to do with all the, all the possible trajectories, right. That we can take through life as we were talking about before and some of them lead to, to suicide sadly enough. And it's, it's always tragic when you have some, you know, somebody with, with great potential resulting in the things that happen. Right. People love it. When I ask about books, I don't know if, whether technical, like legal or fiction non-fiction books throughout your life have had an impact on you. If there's something you could recommend or something you could speak to while something that inspired ideas, insights about this world, complicated world of ours."
"Do you share this tension? I mean, there, there is a real tension that it seems like even like the law, the legal system is all just a construct of our human ideas. And yet it seems to be almost feels fundamental to what a just society is."
"So for somebody like me, so growing up in the Soviet union, the struggle, the civil rights movement, the struggle of race and all those kinds of things of that, that is, you know, this universal, but it's also very much a journey of the United States. It was kind of a foreign thing that I stepped into. Is that something you would recommend somebody like me to read, or is there other things about race that are good to connect? Because my, my, my flavor of suffering and I'm a Jew as well, my flavor has to do with world war two and the studies of that, you know, all the injustices there."
"So I'm now stepping into a new set of injustices and trying to learn the, the lens"
We've talked about young people a little bit at the beginning of our conversation. Is
"There advice that you could give to a young person today thinking about their career, thinking about their life, thinking about making their way in this world?"
"Yeah, it does seem to be, I don't know what it is, but it does seem to be that fear is a good indicator of something you should probably face. Fear kind of shows the way a little bit. Not always, you might not want to go into the cage with a lion, but, but it's, maybe you should maybe let me ask sort of a darker question. Cause we're talking about this, the Husky, well might as well. Do you, do you and connected to the freeing innocent people?"
Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your own death? Are you afraid of death?
"The mystery of it, you know, for, for somebody, at least for me, we, human beings want to figure everything out, whatever the afterlife is, there's still a mystery to it. That, that uncertainty, yeah. It can be terrifying if you ponder it. But maybe what you're saying is you haven't pondered it too deeply so far and it's worked out pretty good. It's worked out."
"So you said again to CFC kind of, or was exceptionally good at getting to the core of what it means to be human. Do you think about like the why of why we're here? The meaning of this whole existence? Yeah,"
"Do you still see yourself as a student? Of course, yes."
"Well, Ron, I'm so glad that somebody like you is carrying the fire of what is the best of Harvard. So it's a huge honor that you spend so much time waste so much of your valuable time with me. I really appreciate it. I think a lot of people love it. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ronald Sullivan and thank you to Brooklinen sheets, wine access, online wine store, monk pack, low carb snacks and Blinkist app that summarizes books, click their links to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela."
"When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice, but to become an outlaw. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."
Is it tragic or beautiful to you that some of the closest bonds that are formed between people are through war often?
What are the obvious reasons? Why is it so obvious?
What is it about the trauma of war that makes bonds difficult to break?
And there's nothing like that team outside of the realm of war.
"There's a very particular nature to the kind of war that will war two was especially for the Soviet union where it didn't just influence the lives of people. It created culture, the music, the poetry, the literature is it's in the it's in the way people think it's in the way people see the world it's in the way they talk even still to this day. And of course I was talking about the directly relationship between two soldiers, but there's something about the depth of human connection, that results from this almost like reverberations of war, like generations later, you're still close to other humans."
"You're, you're, there's a coldness towards other humans in Russia. But once you open up its depth, you seek depth of connection versus like breadth of a career, kind of thinking, how can I make friends with this? I can move into this direction. What can this person benefit me? You instead, you seek a depth of human connection and appreciation."
"That brings a lot. And maybe I'm romanticizing war here, but it feels like that's inextricably connected to world war II for Russians. Is there, does that resonate at all?"
"So in your podcast and your writing, you talk about some of the most fascinating things I listened to you talk about in terms of military conflict is a tactics instead of the details of, of,"
"But allow me to stick on world war two for a second. There's a particular aspect to that war. I don't know if you could speak to it where twice the number of civilians died, that military personnel. So the Soviet union, especially, you know, my, my grandfather was a machine gunner on in Ukraine, as the Germans are marching towards Moscow. There's this main, there's a important push in 1941, where they were trying to get before the winter to, to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing is he was basically throwing bodies at, at to slow the attack."
"And what that meant is everybody understood that you, your job was you have this heavy machine. Guns is very, it's almost unreasonable to be able to be mobily kind of way with them. So you're, you're thrown at the front and you're just non-stop shooting. And you know, 95 plus percent of people are just dead of the soldiers are just dead. And then you just going back and back, and you're trying to protect as many civilians as you can throw out this whole process, but you don't. And so you have millions of civilians that die along the way after this March. Is there something you could say about this complete, perhaps it's naive of me to say, but a war that lacks tactics, that lacks strategy and is purely about just no consideration of human life and just throwing bodies and bullets into mixed together with millions die."
"And that in particular felt much less like conflict and much more like torture or suffering. It didn't, it didn't come off as torture only that interestingly enough, as you probably know my grandfather, including everybody else volunteered, they were proud to do this. They were proud to March to their death for country, for love of country. But the question on the civilian side, when, when more civilians died of the military personnel, what do you make of that?"
It's awful.
"You often talk about leadership. Let's put the evils of Hitler aside, the boldness of Hitler in making some of the strategic decisions he did was considered by many military historians, quite brilliant, early in the war or insane and brilliant stolen. On the other hand, I think university has seen as somebody who is terrible, military strategists, especially early in the war, he did not see all the possible trajectories that the war could take. Is there something you could say about failure of leadership Stalin also the United Kingdom before Churchill and also FDR in the United States side, who basically was trying to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening over there with a perspective of, we just want to make w we wanted to keep America's interest as the primary interest and everything else led to other countries work out their problems."
Many people consider that war adjust war. What do you think makes adjust war?
Is there some gray area here?
"The United States has been involved in a lot of military conflict since then. How do you draw the line to the gray area? What, what war should we engage in? And not, I know you don't get into politics much, but what the decision to go to war,"
"You know, even the United States, the atomic bomb, nuclear weapons is an interesting one because there's a lot of, A lot of hesitation on that. There's a lot of critics of that decision as it was happening. So even America, you can imagine other countries like Germany would not be so hesitant to use nuclear weapons. It's interesting to think about in deciding military strategy to inject ethics into it into morality is not just about winning the war, but should we do this and doing the calculation of human life."
"Usually those decisions are made by leaders, not by the soldier. That's going to be implementing that. The, the, the, that decision. Do you put some responsibility? I should even say blame on the leaders and not doing that kind of calculation here. You could say that you could say that about the Vietnam war. You can say that about even the war that you're involved with in Iraq. Is there some criticism here that you could apply to leaders for failing not to consider the broader moral questions?"
Yes. Natural. Like all leaders will make these mistakes or should leaders not make these mistakes
Saying I made a mistake that resulted in a loss at scale of human life. Being able to say that.
Can I ask you about the loss of human life? How does killing a human being change you? What does it mean to kill a human being? What does it feel like to kill a human being?
"You said move through that. Is there some calculation here that a soldier when they kill another soldier or realization that is just another human being? I mean, is there some heavy burden to that aspect that it's ultimately just human on human?"
"Yeah. Rock is different. And America's position is different. You're right. That America is not involved in a war where it's quite like two humans fighting, like teenage boys fighting against each other."
"Yeah. I suppose I worry about the dehumanization at a much larger scale when it's not the kind of case that you're talking about, even now, hopefully I'm not fear-mongering, but there's a sense in which there's the drums of war slowly starting to build with China there, in the best case, it would be a cold war of there's a dehumanization aspect that's happening with China currently, which is there the other and thereafter stealing all of your data, there's a cybersecurity."
"It starts with cyber security. And it worries me because it creates the other out of a very large population that, that may ultimately lead to conflict in the worst case, hot conflict, that would no longer be the situation you are in, in Iraq, and more similar to the Soviet union conflict with, with Germany that it's kids. And then they're dehumanized to where you're at scale, slaughtering them, or at least hurting their quality of life in a way that's maybe, you know, suffering has many forms."
"It doesn't have to be through just the hot war. It could be through starvation, through camps, all those kinds of things. And I worry, I worry about that. We kind of tend to think that these wars are behind us and I'm not always so sure that's the case. And at least in the way that it ultimately starts with hate. And it, again, hopefully I'm not being too dramatic, but I, I see that there's a kind of brewing of, it starts to dehumanization. That turns to hate of the other. You see that with China, you see it a little bit with Russia, and you have an early podcast with, between the, the, where you break down the tactics of the Chechen war versus Russia."
"Fascinating. But that's the kind of conflicts I'm referring to. And I don't know, there's I know you're a bit of a musician. I love, I love dire straits song called brothers in arms. I don't know if you know that one and there's a line in it. I think they, they play it quite often in military funerals, which I just recently learned, but it's this powerful song. There's a line we're fools to make war on our brothers in arms. Do you think there's some sense in which at the leadership level, but just as human beings, we're perhaps foolish and engaging in military conflict as much as we have, or is full of very inappropriate word here?"
Yeah.
But if there is a
"You had a conversation with Jordan Peterson where he asked you a question in terms of war being last resort, whether you would like your kids to grow up in peace at time of no war, you said yes, but it so happens. Jordan, didn't let you finish. Can you, can you elaborate? What falls the butt? Well, yeah,"
So
Okay.
The absolute best
You mentioned the worst. What are some of the worst aspects of when you were in Iraq? What are the things that I'm The hardest on you
Is there a absurd cruelty to it? Was it due to mistakes or natural consequences of fighting? Is there any difference? Is that at the end is just losing. Those are brothers in arms.
Is there some aspect which makes it worse when there's mistakes made?
"But to you, the things that hurt is just losing, losing people close to you."
Are you yourself afraid of death?
"Do you think about it? Does it make sense to you that this thing ends like you, the Stoics contemplated death, it gives flavor to life. It makes you appreciate there's something about finiteness of life that makes it, that makes it this a Jocko, discipline, go drink, sour, apple, that I'm enjoying. It's delicious, makes it taste better because I'm going to die one day. And I think about that a lot. Do you think about it"
"What about when you were in combat nothing there's there's tactics or strategy, there's the mission. And then your mortality is not part of the calculation."
"Can I ask you about love of country? Is it's. It continues to just how much I've studied Stalin recently in the past few years, it continues to surprise me, not surprise me. It's it's just tragic in some kind of way. I'm not sure exactly if I could put words to it, but how many people still do, but at the time were willing, loved, stolen, and were willing to die for country for the love of country. And I too, maybe because I was born there and now I am a red blooded American."
"I love nationalism is a bad word, but I love the love of country. It gives it somehow gives a meaning like a brotherhood, like we're in this together. I love, that's why I love the Olympics. That's just the, the unity of it. It takes a step out of the selfish pursuits of any one particular ant and looks at us as a big ant colony. And it's inspiring. It's it's exciting. But at the same time, it seems to get us to do horrible things."
"If, if manipulated by charismatic leaders, what do you make of this love of country? Is it a, is it a bad thing? Is it a thing that gets in the way or is it a good thing?"
"So my, my area of work is artificial intelligence. It'd be interesting to ask your thoughts about something which is autonomous weapon systems us has now officially released the report saying that they're open to not open. They're engaging in adding more and more autonomy and artificial intelligence into its weapon systems because China's doing it. And so there's, these are the first steps in something that AI folks worry about, which is a race, an AI race in the space of autonomous weapons that can run away too quickly."
"Is that something I don't know if in general, if you have thoughts about weapon systems that make autonomous decisions at the small scale of just targeting where to shoot and the largest scale of military strategy of just being given a mission of destroy this particular target, this particular say terrorists, human being, and then figure out what is the right bombing campaign on your own to accomplish this task that minimize a civilian death, and then just loading that in and letting the AI system automatically decide that what are your general thoughts about it?"
"Do you, do you worry about it? Because as the positive effects that in the best version of that world, you kill fewer civilians. You kill hurt fewer of your own human beings, but at the negative side of that, you might lose the thing we kind of talked about, which is the basic humanity, even in the individual soldier of what is right, and what is wrong and not making huge mistakes that hurt thousands or millions of people."
"The problem is if you've ever used machines of any kind, their initial design may not be there. There's unintended consequences. There's there's ways in the, the machine actually behaves that you realize there's bugs in this thing."
"You do? But the question is, this is the first time in human history. You can create things, machines, toaster, microwave, oven, that's smarter than you in this particular task. I mean, it's not yet there w w where you're learning a lot with military strategies, humans are actually really damn smart. It's very hard to do to improve on a human. And so most actual drones that are unmanned are still piloted by humans is very difficult to do every aspect of war, but it's not an out of the realm of possibility that machines will start doing those things better."
"And it's a certain, certain things, a certain more precise targeting of the enemy. The question is, so what happens when you start to rely on the machine to do some of the task is you get lazy. You forget what it is like to do that task, or more importantly, you lose the knowledge of the intricacies of that task, and you forget the ways it can go wrong. So the protocols may not be sufficient to constrain the power of the ways that things go wrong, especially when things are moving really quickly, especially when the ethics of the two sides aren't perfectly aligned when people are some certain sides like Chinese side may be more willing to take risks for dangerous consequences than others."
"So what happened on the by weapon side is internationally. Maybe you could speak to this more, but my sense, what I was told, there was a sense globally that bio weapons are not going to be used. They're unethical. There's a sense, like we're not going to engage in this. And with AI currently, China and us said, Greenlight, all, go ahead. It's, it's totally ethical. If, if it can decrease the loss of human life, why not? And my worry is that it's much more, it's, it's much easier to design weapons that are effective than design weapons who have the depth of ethics and morals that humans do, which I think we don't assume beings don't acknowledge enough that even like the cold calculated killing of others, like precise, effective execution of a mission still has ethics in it at every level, you know, what's right."
"And what's wrong. And I don't know if that, I don't know if you take that away, you're not going to make huge mistakes that you regret. Is that something you don't worry about?"
"I'm kind of worried that this is something you don't worry about because a lot of people, I respect, don't worry about it. And I don't know what to do about that. A lot of generals, don't worry about it. A lot of people who know much more about war, like you than me, don't worry about it. And that worries me"
"I mean, it's like, again, from the Soviet union Chernobyl meltdown, there was always the ability I believe to have a kill switch. The problem is the more power you give to the machine, the more opportunity you give to the, to the human supervise and that machine to make a mistake and not shut off the switch at the right time. So yes, the solution, I mean, you're putting the responsibility still in the human hands that I think that's the correct place to put it. There should be good protocols, good leadership, good execution competency, all around your protocols should consider the basic failures of human nature, the human factor of how things go wrong."
"So there should be multiple people supervising the system, all those things. But I am just very skeptical of greater and greater power in the machine that can create war that cannot lead to death. Yeah."
"Caska, Jocko, Willink. A ridiculous question. If human civilization goes extinct will be the reason you mentioned nuclear war. Do you worry about this? The reason I bring that up, a lot of people in the AI community worry about artificial general intelligence. So super intelligent AI systems, creating a lot of damage. Autonomous weapon systems is one possibility. A lot of folks recently, especially with this pandemic, if you want to be terrified, listen, somebody I talked to recently, Sam Harris, he did a four hour podcast on how bioengineering of viruses is likely to destroy human civilization."
"I recommend that highly few, if you were too optimistic about the future of the human species. So apparently they're in the space of bioengineering become is becoming easier and easier and easier to engineer viruses, engineer pathogens. This is the world's most depressing question. What is, do you, is there something in particularly worry about like that we should be thinking as a human species"
"You know what? I'm usually extremely optimistic about the stuff I am now. I'm with you, except we won't. Well, there's always a chance we won't, but I have a sense that human, first of all, I believe that most people have much more capacity for good than evil. All of us are capable of evil. I believe, but most people are much more capable of doing good and want to do good. And I also believe in the resiliency of the human species, that we're in an innovative bunch, and we can respond to tragedy. Especially we respond more to tragedy as the scale of the tragedy grows and our response is much better."
"What makes a great man, let's start at the individual. What makes a great man? What makes a great woman? What makes a great human being?"
"Sentence does a lot of work. There's a, when you're a leader, there's a lot of egos. There's a lot of tension. There's the humans, the human factor. There's people who are timid. There's people who are assholes. There's people who are incredibly competent, but a self obsessed, I don't know, there's complexities of human nature. How do you get all those people to do, to be the best version of themselves and to lift up everyone else around them?"
"We almost like as a case study, look at a few people in the tech area that I'm familiar with, that I know, well,"
"So I'll do my best to brief the I'll do my best to reduce human beings into simple descriptions. And then you can give me insights of why the hell they're such effective leaders based on my description, not based on your actual deep knowledge of the human beings. So that caveat of my inability to speak both English language and describe humans. Well, let's talk about first Elon Musk."
"In the sense of first of all, a very high bar of excellence"
"Also willing to what he calls kind of first principles, thinking of asking the, the questions that hurt,"
"The hell are we doing it this way? Why can't it be done a lot, but not just better, but a lot better."
"I'll bring this point back up with another guy, Steve jobs, but let me stay on the line for a second. The, the other thing he does, which is interesting. I see the value of this. It'd be great to hear you speak about it is unlike many of the other CEOs, very rich billionaires, you know, involved in leading a lot of people. He puts a lot of time into making sure he's on the factory floor. He famously sleeps on the sort of like in the middle of things. And he puts a lot of effort. He's also very good at it is being a low level engineer."
"So like whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details. And he'll talk to the lowest level person in terms of like, you know, somebody who's like working, literally I'm putting parts together. He wants to understand what the problem is, what the challenges, if there's an emergency, he wants to understand the actual details of the problem. Not like delegating it to a manager, but like, cause a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will. We'll talk about sort of the, the, the power and the importance of delegation here. He wants to know if there's a big problem. He wants to know the exact detail. He wants to know the exact problem and wants to at the fundamental level, understand how to solve that problem."
"Whether it has to do with materials, whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing, the mechanical engineering aspect, like we're talking about like engineering. This is a guy who wears a suit as a CEO tweets about Dorsch coin, but like actual job he's low-level engineering. And that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing. That's what, like, he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level. I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me. And I wonder how many people it's inspiring to. Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that of no matter how high their level of leader is to be able to do the low level shit."
"Part of that makes me not want to do a startup is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies. Just like you said, he's not dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering is dealing with like in the, in the case of the company life and death, like something that can just completely damage the production line, right? So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out fires. And I don't know if there's something to be said about the psychology of that, of how, like he he's spoken himself, that he's worried more, that his mind can hold up much longer."
"I think he's done that more successfully and someplace that and others, a space X, a lot of people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of space X as, as a very successful person that runs shit, but in Tesla, not as much. So I wonder if you can comment on something. A lot of people worry about, and this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people worry about that. If you'll on disappears, the, the innovative spirit, the company is, as we know them today will collapse will stagnate and will basically fail to do what they've been doing for so many years successfully."
"Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader that if you disappear, it's still, the things still is on and not just lives on, but thrive."
"He is. But I also seem to notice that there's not many people like him. People become complacent too easily. That disappoint I've been disappointed by people a little bit. I was like, success makes people soft that with Ilan, it seems like success doesn't have any effects as like the reverse effect. It doesn't, it's like, what's the net. It's always like, what's the next biggest thing, right? He's living that exponential growth, which I think that's the problem that you have to have somebody who's constantly trying to find the 10 X solution, like trying to constantly improve things and restlessly that, I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people, not just creating a culture, but creating a culture with the right set of people."
"Speaking of which Steve jobs, there's two things I want to mention there. One is once again, the harshness, but a very different kind. And the second is team building. So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elan in a way in the following way, having a sense that you will not like this, but I'd like to defend it is he loses his shit quite a bit. He was famously at least, especially early on being very emotional, his letting passion dominate the discussion. There'll be a lot of firings."
"There'll be a lot of mean things said to people, I don't know what you make of that. How much is the leader? Are you allowed to just lose your shit in your love for the thing you're doing and how effective is that"
"You're implying a confidence that love is more powerful than fear, but I'm not so sure. It's the monkey valley question. You're saying ultimately it's always better to lead by inspiration and love than by, by putting the fear into the team."
"He has this idea of philosophy of a players, where you have a group like the power and the productivity"
"Of a group of what he called a players is invaluable. So you want to get a team of people who are the best of what they do, but the most important aspect to him was that a single quote, unquote B player on the team destroys the entire productivity of the team. Is there something that rings true to that? So he was a good, this could be a temper thing, but vicious about firing and removing the, a, what he felt was a toxic B player and a team. So a players feed off of each other, unless there's one B player present"
"I think too. There's some multiplying effect of just pure excellence. No matter the personalities. I think for Steve jobs where he does the ego, doesn't matter. None of that matters. What matters is the quality of the output that the genius of the result and that somehow multiplies itself. And they is actually like one of the problems with egos is like, what does ego usually say? It says, I'm much better than you. When you have people that are really good together. It's very hard for the ego to flourish because you're like constantly being shown that you're not as good. And there's a competition."
"So like, I think his idea was that like, if you get people that are really good at what they do, it turns as opposed to you being complacent and not do much and thinking you're better than everyone else in your opinion is better. Is you almost getting in that competitive race? You know, that magic that happens when you're at the end of a marathon and you're just like head to head, like you're just going full steam with a person that is as good as you. There's no place for ego there,"
"So then looking at a completely opposite person, was this a fascinating person to me, Sandra Pichai, who's the CEO of alphabet of Google. I admire the, in a romantic sense, the madness that is a Steve jobs and Elon Musk. So to me, the opposite of that, Sandra <inaudible>, who's like everybody loves him. And he's also a great listener. So he always brings people together. And so w th th the energy of that person room is like the basic energy."
"If I were to summarize it as like, I want to hear all the voices in the room, that's the energy he brings. And it's almost like he doesn't want to impose a final decision. He wants to hear all the voices. And somehow, always the decision just falls out. I don't know what to say about that style of leadership, but it's always surprising to me how that love brought a lot of people together and still, I mean, some of the greatest things Google has done in the over the past several years could be attributed to that continued innovation, bringing out the best out of people."
"There's of course, bureaucracy, which I could criticize the end of the day, which always happens with big companies. I would argue actually the dictatorial style of Steve jobs and Elon Musk help fight the bureaucracy, which is one criticism I would give of being a listener and being kind is sometimes you can't cut through the bullshit as effectively, but he he's. One of the only people I've ever heard of everybody loves he's inspirational figure to millions, especially in like in India, he's a celebrity in the best kind of way. Is there something you can say about that kind of leadership, where you're never the asshole, you're never the dictator, you're always the listener and the, the compassionate, empathetic glue that brings the team together, basically with love, you know, that's, that's great leadership."
"If you had to choose for Google for large companies, is there something you'd be said about what is more effective? The dictator, the ruling by love or ruling by fear, first of all,"
"We got it. And all of them actually do this interesting thing. I'd love to hear your opinion on it certainly does it to a large degree, which is it's in the process of delegation, trusting a person to do a really difficult thing, like tossing it up and saying like, I trust you can get this job done for some, even if your resume does not support the hip, I'm actually kind of a amazed the human beings. When they're given the trust to get the job done, they step up very often has kind of an amazing property of human nature."
"Some of that is judging human character is like there's potential. There is something in this person that they are, they have enough demons or whatever the hell it requires have that fuel. They'll figure it out. They'll hate themselves. If they don't and they'll find the right, the, find the tools or find the path though, to, to achieve the, whatever the level of perfection they can. It's been really surprising to me. It's been making me rethink the whole hiring process because I often now I'm thinking, looking for, so I'm looking for people, both for the startup, but just for my own life or help. And I almost want to see evidence of excellence, but maybe you want to just base on just judgment if human character, without evidence of excellence, have people step up like Joe Rogan with Jamie was a funny side."
"I didn't understand how little Joe knew about Jamie when he hired him and Jamie stepped up and now runs the one of the most successful podcasts ever. And that's an incredible kind of, and he's one of the best producers in the world now, not to let it get to his head. And by the way, the funny thing about him and one of the best Googlers in the world have been the best Googlers. The funny thing about Jamie, this is okay, you might, you might not like this, but what I, what I like, I'm constantly exceptionally self-critical to a point of night, self hating. Sometimes I deeply appreciate every single moment I'm alive, but everything I've ever done, I feel like is shit."
"And when I talked to Jamie about everything he's done, he's just in every way he carries himself. He's so self-critical, he's so like, worried that it's wrong is bad. That anxious energy. I love it because that's how you lead to growth and progress. Like you might like a therapist might say, that's probably not good for your like, wellbeing. Fuck it. It's good for the what's good for your wellbeing is to create awesome things. That's ultimately what leads to happiness is to, to create the best thing you can in your life. And so when I see that in somebody like Jamie or anybody, I talk to when you're really self critical, that's a good sign to me."
I is that ridiculous?
Hear that Jamie don't get cocky on occasion. Rarely you talk about a discipline. What is a discipline life look like
What if I want to lay on the couch and eat Cheetos and watch soap operas? That's that's not that doesn't feel like discipline.
"Well, you know, you could argue from a sort of a meaning of life perspective that perhaps happiness is the most important. And if it makes me happy, perhaps that's, if it's fulfilling,"
"Of course, eating Cheetos and watching some poppers is fulfilling for nobody whatsoever. Next question. But there's something about discipline. That's more than that, which is like the rigor of habit, right? You, you wake up early in the morning, all the time. What is it? Jordan Peterson talks about make your bed one place where you probably agree with Jordan."
"Okay. So what in your life, maybe we can talk about the one that's most publicly facing, which is you wake up at four o'clock or around four o'clock in the morning. He posts on social media, a picture of your, watch, it being early, just to remind people that you, you are man of your word. What's that about? What's the philosophy of the four o'clock. What role does that play in a discipline life for you?"
"Let's break this down. Then what does then the rest of the day look like? What is the perfect productive discipline day in the life of Jocko? Willink look like wake up, workout, wake up 1, 4, 4 30, or cot 1, 5, 5 to six or seven. No eating. No. And then what is the workout look like? Depends on the day. What's what's the perfect. We're talking about body weight, lifting cardio, a heavy bag."
A jujitsu.
"That this is the thing that has the pictures of the aftermath was since this was something, there was some sweat at the, so the goal is to do whatever the hell results in some sweat. And that takes an hour."
"You got some demons to work through or is this just, is this just work? Like, are we, so you got the David Goggins. Who's like, who clearly has demons screaming inside of his head that he's trying to work through? Are you just getting the work done out of the discipline? Or is this a, I think Joe is a little bit of a David Goggins is like, there's some ego. There's some bullshit that you're trying to get out there. Some of the exercise, that's a good way to kind of humble you is just doing that exercise."
What does a w what do you do after talk about food?
"Let's say they're good. This is a perfect day is a perfect, perfect ways. Why do you surf?"
"Okay, man, man, and nature, it was just like, what surfing is? The ultimate is the power of the infinite power of the ocean versus a little silly looking man on a board,"
Russian and romance. That's okay. This is for fun in the morning. Beautiful. And this is you're still haven't eaten. No. Okay. So when do you eat?
"I'm grazing. What's the, what's the diet, the supper. Is there a perfect diet or do you graze?"
Does it work entering any of this? I'm sure you have a lot of people that want your attention.
"Is there a parts of the day where you try to find moments to think deeply, to read deeply to sort of really focused cause this world wants is full of distractions, right?"
"Even talking to like even work stuff, the emails and all those kinds of things that can, they can scatter your mind. Is there a time as you seek to have that focus? Well,"
"What does the rest of the day look like? Just a lot of work, but once the jujitsu, I want to find out about the jujitsu. So"
"Yep. And how hard you still hi, how are you doing? Body-wise they still the old man, the old man still got it. Or are you talking to me? It would be good for viewership and ratings if I die before the end of the podcast. So"
"And food wise, you mentioned grazing as some of some nuts have very light kind of things. Is there a main meal here at night? At night? Yep. Hi, in protein or is it anything?"
"So is there a thing where at the end of the, at the end of the day, you will like, you have like a summarized sword and you meditate on death and all those kinds of, is there some weird ritual?"
Is there a key to you that you can speak to that makes for a productive day? Just the way you approach it mentally?
"And then get it done. Yeah,"
"Can I ask you a budget? So by all means what have you learned from being a practitioner you're a black belt. What have you learned from this journey of being a martial artist? Do you do through, for me was the connective tissue that"
"Elaborate? Because you've trained for many, many years. What is it? The hardship? Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over? You know, non-stop I don't, I actually don't know how many times I've tapped more times than you. Okay. So good. Is it just the hardship of physical training? Like the honesty of the mat in the sense that like, you know, what works and what doesn't work, which, which aspects were the most impactful for you all?"
"Maybe not directly, unless I'm a white belt. Exactly."
"You've also competed. Is there something you can speak to the value of competition? Obviously you've been through combat actual military combat is many, many, many orders of magnitude, more high stakes than competition in a S in a silly sport like jujitsu. Nevertheless, it's still has some of the echoes of the same challenges. Is there something you could speak to the value of competition for you?"
"So that that's very useful to sort of, yeah. As a testing ground, of course, training can be that testing ground as well, or, or that feedback"
"So you mentioned offline that your friends and you work with Dean Lister and Dean Lister is one of the people that inspired John Donahoe, who I've very much been. I've gotten a chance to talk to quite a bit recently. I don't know what you think about this. This is not a therapy session, but, or maybe it isn't. One is turning into one. I've that he's a fascinating person. John Donna, her in terms of creating almost a science of jujitsu to a level that I haven't seen before, which is a systems about, like, you can think about military combat as tactics in a particular situation, but then you zoom out and you want to create entire systems of tactics in all situations, right."
"He's very, kind of wants to keep zooming out and creating giant systems. And which I appreciate that even though the task is probably impossible to do completely, but there's something that's in terms of competition, that he kindled a fire in me that I want to get back out there. He has a particular thing that did it, which was very different from my personal journey in jujitsu, which was to degree that a people I worked with cared about competition."
"It was always about winning and, or doing well, all those kinds of things for John it's about winning that like winning is not, is not even the thing that's important. What's most important is winning by submission is or dominance. Right? And, and not just the, the end is the entire time competing such that the only thing that matters is that kind of victory. And that's a very different level of competition. That's actually liberating in a certain kind of sense. I w I remember so much of my competition was about kind of fear of not taking risks."
"You know, you get up on points or you hold a strong position, you kind of advanced and you get more points. Maybe you chase the submission, but there's always a fear of risk. And for him, you embrace the risk. You're not, you should not be competing out of fear, you know, live and die by the sword versus a stay in safety. I don't know if there's something to be said here."
"All right. Let's ask for some advice for white belts, there's a lot of white belts to listen to this. What advice would you give a, you've been ingested for many years in terms of a successful journey through jiu-jitsu. What advice would you give them? People just starting out,"
"It's perhaps counterintuitive and never was to me. But it's counterintuitive that to, to start on the journey of really sort of mastering digits or whatever, or improving is you have to relax. And that seems to be a very counterintuitive lesson. I learned that early on with that was thanks to the Russian system. I played piano and music, but basically, actually, this is true for basically any sport that includes the human body is like relaxing is the way you, you start learning stuff. You have to learn. You have to literally, and most people don't seem to understand. This is like, you have to learn what it means for the human body to relax."
"Like, I guess you have to have enough knowledge of all the muscles involved to know what it means to relax those muscles. So for piano, you have to understand what it means to relax your wrists and your fingers in order to learn how to move them. Like if there's tenseness in the thing, mirrors, you're not going to, like, you have to learn how to try hard while relaxed the, the, I guess the beginner, if you don't internalize this lesson will try hard by tensing up hard and like trying hard, tensing up more as opposed to relaxing more. And that lesson can not be conveyed through words."
"I guess I've had the great fortune of having dictatorial teachers as they do in Russia for, for piano and so on. We get like hit, if you don't learn to relax, which is a counterintuitive notion, but it works. Yes."
"That's, that's beautiful"
"For somebody who studied war, who participated in war, what do you think is the best martial arts for let's call it self defense for hand-to-hand combat outside the constraints of sport."
"Yeah, there's a, there's certain in the standing position. I mean, I'm, I'm a judo person as well. And the judo is very limited in their understanding of the full grappling spectrum. Even though they do all the things on the ground as well, but it's so focused on the feet, but nevertheless, it's important to understand the thing that judo has as a sport, as good to practice. That just doesn't is not just the GRA the skill of grappling and the feet, but the skill of explosive aggression that sometimes you just is more about in terms of tactics is more about patients and didn't mean to pass how you practice it."
"But because so much is a about control technique that sometimes you don't get to practice like aggression, explosive aggression, and judo is so much about aggression implemented in such a way that the demonstration of powers effortless. Right? That's the beauty of it."
Are there books and movies in your life long ago recently that had a big impact on you?
"An exceptional warrior, a soldier, soldier, if you can give a little inkling, what made him a soldier, soldier?"
"On me. And like I said, I still, I still read it all the time. I reread it all the time. And I always take lessons from it. Let me ask you about love. This is not usually associated with Jocko, but what role does love in terms of friendship, in terms of family play in a successful life in life, in general, again, this is putting other people above yourself. Do you see that as the love? That's ultimately the implementation of love? I would say yes, Jocko. I've been a huge fan of yours. You're somebody who inspires me to get up early, to get shit done, to be disciplined about my life and to be the best leader I can be."
"It's really, truly an honor. And a thank you for wasting all your valuable time with me. I don't know what you were thinking, but thank you for doing it. Well, thanks for having me on. I can guarantee you, I'm not as cool as you just made me sound. I'm just out here. Like I said, trying to help people out. And I, and I think you're helping a lot of people out with your podcast. So thanks for having me up here to share some of my experiences, and hopefully I'll see you on the mat one day, for sure. Looking forward to it could be sooner than you think. And it sounds like a threat. I love it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jocko Willink,"
"Check them out in a description to support this podcast. And now they may leave you with some words from Jocko Willink. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."
"Right? So that's the difference between sort of energy and genetic code. So like energy and information are, those are the two kind of, is there, yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it. It's"
"Okay. So w which one is your favorite? I don't like either. Okay. Right. Can we talk about them for a little bit longer though? So, cause there's a early earth, what was that like? Was there just mostly covered by oceans? Was there a heat sources, energy sources? So if we talk about the metabolism view of the origin of life, like where was the source of energy? Probably the most"
"Okay. And for the genetic code, the idea is that the RNA is the first, like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it's life? I guess the idea is it could both have persistent information and then it can also do some of the work of like what creating a self-sustaining organism,"
Isn't it amazing that RNA came to be in general? Isn't it? Yes. That is amazing. Okay. So we're not talking Don about RNA.
"Not, it's just not step one."
"So if a life was like a best of album, it would be on the, be one of the songs on there. Yeah. One of the early songs. Okay. It's on the greatest hits, greatest hits. That's the word I was looking for. Okay. Did a life, do you think originate once, twice, three times on earth, multiple times? What do you think?"
"I'm going to have to talk to you about the shadow bias here in a second. But first I may ask for the other alternative, which is panspermia right? So that's the idea, the hypothesis that life exists elsewhere in the universe and God to us, then we're like an asteroid or planetoid or some according to Wikipedia space, us, whatever the heck. That is a, it sounds fun, but basically wrote along whatever kind of rock and got to us. Do you think that's at all a possibility? Sure."
"It's possible that that would be a sign that you could separate the environment from the basic ingredients. So you can have like a live gun that you shoot throughout the universe. And then like once you shoot it, things like the Simpsons with a makeup gun, that was a great episode. When you shoot this life gun, it'll, it'll find the earths. It'll like get sticky, it'll stick to the earth. And that kind of reduces the barrier of like the time it takes the, the luck it takes to actually from nothing from the basic chemistry from them, basic physics, the universe for the lights to spring up."
"Okay. So if we were to think about life as a planetary phenomenon, as a life on Mars would be best if it's way than life"
"On earth, we have to ask the very basic question of what is life."
"So answering the question of what is life requires deeply understanding something about the universe as information processing universe is computation. It's something about like, would a, once you come up with an answer to what is life, will the words, information and computation be in the paragraph that dammit, okay,"
So what what's wrong? Is it too ambiguous? The word information we could switch the binary if you want.
"Sometimes fundamental, you think"
"So do you think this, the set of things that could exist as finite very large, but like, if we were to think about the physics of existence, like how, how many shapes of mugs can there be like it is in the initial programming"
So that's not a typology question. I just mean maybe another way to ask is what do you think is fundamental to the universe of what is emergent so existence. I was supposed to think of that as somehow fundamental you think?
That's an interesting thing you said is the way we think about information computation is by observing a particular
"Kind of systems on earth that exhibits something we think of as intelligence, but that's, that's like looking at, I guess, the tip of an iceberg. And we should be really looking at the fundamentals of like the iceberg, like, like, like what makes water and ice and, and the chemistry that from which intelligence emergencies essentially. Yeah."
"Yeah. But I guess I'm trying to figure out what, what do you think are the best tools to look at it? What do you think"
The physics of an open mind?
"Right? So it's like turtles on top of turtles, but eventually it gets to the human mind. And then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles. So you have to, it comes from humans, this understanding this simplification of the university's models. There's a guy named Stephen Wolf from there's a concept called cellular automata. So there's, there's some mysteries in these systems that are"
"In nature that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries we should need to solve to understand what is life. So if we could talk, take a computational view of things, do you think there's something compelling to reducing everything down to a computation like the universe has computation and then trying to understand life. So throw away the biology, throw it, the chemistry, throw away even the physics that you, you learn undergrad and graduate school, and a more look at these simple little systems, whether it's cellular automata or whatever the heck kind of computational systems that operate on simple local rules and then create complexity as they evolve."
"Is, is it at all, you think productive to focus on those kinds of systems to get an inkling of what is life and if it is, do you think it's possible to come up with some kind of laws and principles about what makes life in those competitional systems?"
It's like really surprised. It is
"That's trippy the hope of physics. It's a hope, I guess, but often stated as a underlying assumption is that the law is a static. Right. Okay."
"The time in general, like you want to remove time from the equation as much as possible."
"So, cause that's what, when you say time, you mean causation in your proposed model of the physics of life, the, the fundamental thing would be causation. If you were to bet your money on one particular horse or whatever. Yes. And then space is emergent. Yes. So everything's emergent except time"
Let's change all the time. Why does it look like laws the same?
"So there's no shortcuts to, you"
"Well, I appreciate that togetherness of that, but so how does that, if we have to simulate the entire universe to create the ornaments in the two of us, how are we supposed to create engineer life?"
Ideas are injecting life. Yes.
"Adding any actual, like chemistry biology that it could be identified as the life are the constraints we're adding to the experiment of the design of the experiment,"
"Can we, can we have, so can, is it possible in the lab to have an information vacuum then? So like"
"Yeah. You guys, by the way, for people who don't know Lee Cronin is you guys are colleagues and I've gotten a chance to listen to the two of you talking. There's great sort of chemistry in your brilliant brainstorming together. And there's, there's a really exciting community here of brilliant people from different disciplines working on the problem of life of complexity of, I dunno, whatever the words fail us to describe the exact problem with trying to actually understand here intelligence, all those kinds of things. Okay. So what, what, from a lab perspective, so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?"
No.
"So why, why is it so hard to create? And it's an interesting question to create biological life in the lab. Like from your perspective, is that an important problem to work on, to try to recreate the historical origin of life on earth or echoes of the historical?"
So existence comes to be at the chemical level. So existence is most is best understood at the chemical.
"So can I ask a weird question, which is, so let's look into the future, the"
"So say a Nobel prize is given in physics, maybe chemistry for discovering the origin of life. No, not, but not the historical origin, some kind of thing that we're talking about, what exactly would, what do you think that, like, what did you think that person maybe you did to get that Nobel prize? Like what would they have to have done? Because you could do a bunch of experiments that go like with an aha moment. Like you rarely get the Nobel prize for like, you've solved everything we're done."
"Right. It's like some inkling of some deep truth, right? Like what do you think that would actually look like? Would it be an experimental result? I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental maybe validation component. So what, what would that look,"
"Well, so that's, that's one Nobel prize winning experiment, which is like information in some fundamental way originated within the constraints of the system without you injecting anything. But another experiment is you injected something. Yeah. And got out information. Yes. So like you injected, I don't know, like, like some sugar and like sometimes something that doesn't necessarily feel like it should be information."
Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah. Yes.
So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.
"Well, yes. Speak so speak for yourself. You're you're, you're projecting your consciousness onto me. You don't know if I'm conscious or not. Is, is that, is he, he talked about the physics of existence. You talked about the emergence of, of causality. Sorry, you talked about causality and time being fundamental to the universe. Where does consciousness fit into all of this? Like do you, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value where the idea of panpsychism that may be one of the things that we ought to understand is the physics of consciousness."
"Like one of the missing pieces in the physics view of the world is understanding the physics of consciousness or like that word has so many concepts that are underneath it, but let's put it, let's put consciousness as a label on a black box of mystery that we don't understand. Do you think that box holds the key to finally answering the question of the physics of life?"
"So sorry to interrupt. So when you say we, you mean humans,"
But you think there's something special to this particular?
"But are you one entity? You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah. Like, do you think of yourself as one entity or are you just a bunch of different components? Like, is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah? Like, or are you just a bunch of different things that are like a nice little temporary side effect that"
"But, but you you've, but nevertheless, that bundle of information has become conscious or at least keeps calling herself conscious. Yeah."
So the stuff happened. It's just as a good question to ask the stuff happen. If consciousness is
"But I mean, you're saying information is physical to virtual reality simulation program is physical too in the, yeah."
"Right? So you, I love your Twitter. So tweet these like deep thoughts, deep thoughts."
"Sitting there. I mean, I could just imagine you sit in there for like hours and all of a sudden, just like this thought comes out and you get a little like inkling into the thought process."
"One of the things he tweeted is ideologically, there are many parallels between the search for neural correlates of consciousness and for chemical correlates of life, how the neuroscience and astrobiology communities treat those correlates is entirely different. Can you elaborate against this kind of the parallels? It has to do a little bit with the consciousness and the, and the, and the matter thing you're talking about."
Never thought you're going to have to analyze your heart.
It is a historical here.
"So, so go, let's see how the conscious of walls on this one. Yeah."
"So that's from a neuroscience perspective, it's like fake it till you make it. So you, you fake whatever the correlates are. And hopefully that the that's going to summon the thing that is consciousness. And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life is it that sounds like that's an awesome concept. Is that something that people,"
"Chemical correlates of life. That's a good title. I mean, first of all, your, your papers too, that people should check out, have great titles or baby papers you're involved with. So your, your tweets and titles are stellar and also your ideas, but the tweets and titles are much more important. So yeah, it's more diffuse though. Well, it's yeah. It's the charge. The tweet is the Trojan horse of the idea that, that sticks on for a long time. Okay. So is there anything to say about the chemical coral? So what you're saying there, similar kind of ways of thinking about it, but you, you mentioned about the communities."
Do you think consciousness can be engineered in the same way that life can be?
"Oh, you're backtracking and that was predestined."
"Let's continue. The deep analysis of your tweets. You said that determinism in a tweet, determinism and randomness play important roles in understanding what life is. So let me ask on this topic of free will, what is determinism? What is randomness and why the heck do they have anything to do with understanding life?"
You didn't even capitalize a tweet by the way. It was all lowercase. I must've been angry. Can you analyze the emotion behind that frustration? Or
"Or more, most stable. So like most reliable, most of the, for, for our, for how we, for the tools of physics, but what right. Well, so where's the random has come from then if, okay, so you, you were at speaking with a tangent, so I'm not sure where we are in all of the universe is a kind of tangent. So we're embracing the tangent. So freewill you believe at this current time that you have free, will I believe my whole"
"I still believe it. You still believe it. So at the same time, you think that in your conception of the universe, causality seems to be pretty fundamental, which kind of wants the university to be deterministic. So how the heck, because you have a free will and yet you value causality"
"So where's the randomness, where's the magic that gives birth to the freewill? Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?"
"No, but do you, Sarah have a choice about what's going to happen next? Oh, I see if the universe could I have, if I run this thing, so you have a choice, where's the choice come from? Does it,"
"So this is fascinating in some sense,"
"I mean, in some sense, if you look at like a general relativity and gravity morphing space time, and that same way, maybe whatever the physics of consciousness might be, it might be morphing. That's like what freewill is, it's morphing like the space, just like ideas, make rockets come to life. It's somehow changing the space of possible realizations of like whatever's. Yeah. Okay. But that's,"
"But it's probabilistic. So you do think like God plays dice. So let me,"
"Well, it's possible that our mind is not able to hold the current concepts of mind at all. Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly. Maybe the words deterministic or random or not the right even words, concerts to be, do we hold it, but maybe you can talk to the theory of everything. The, this attempt in the current set of physical laws to try to unify them. Is there any hope that once a theory of everything is developed and by theory of everything, I mean, in a narrow sense of unifying quantum fields area and general relativity, do you think that will contain some, like in order to do that unification, you would have to get something that will then give hints about the physics of life, physics of existence, physics of consciousness."
"Can we talk about aliens anytime as a one? I think one interesting way to sneak up on the question of what is life is to ask, what should we look for in alien life? You know, if we were to look out into our galaxy in, into the universe and come up with a framework of how to detect alien life, what should we be looking for? Is there like set of rules, like as both the tools and the tools that are served the census for certain kinds of properties of life."
So what should we look for in alien life?
That's really fascinating. I get out
"Of my head, I'd start imagining Legos and all the legs I've ever built and how many steps, what is the shortest path to, to the final, final little Lego castles."
"So when you observe a thing on another planet, you're essentially the process looks like reverse engineering, trying to figure out what is the shortest path to create that."
"Yeah. And I guess what you and Lee are saying that there's a heuristic, that's a good metric for a, like better perhaps than chemical correlates. Yes."
"But how do you do that initial kind of say, I'm walking down the street and I'm looking for that double-take test of like, like the hell is"
"That like, that, that initial, like, how do we look for the possibility of weirdness as a possibility of higher assembly number Y what would aliens look like? The, if they don't have two eyes and are green, I would have probably already solved the problem. Right. There's another Nobel prize in there somewhere."
"I mean, there's some, like there's an engineering question here of, are there sensors we can create that can give us a, can help us discover a certain pockets of high assemblies? Billions, like, I mean, there is a hope that setting dogs and chairs aside,"
"There's a hope that visually, and we could detect like, because our universe, I mean, at least the way we look at it now, like this three-dimensional link space time, we can visually comprehend it. It's interesting to think, like if we got the hangout, you know, if there's an alien in this room, like, would we be able to detect it with our current sensors, not the fancy kinds, but like what camp over there standing over there, or maybe like in this carpet, see, there's all these kinds of patterns. Right. I don't know if, if I don't know if this carpet is an alien"
"I mean, that is a very kind of rigorous computer vision question. Can we visually, is there a strong correlation between certain kinds of high assembly objects when they get to the scale where they're visually observable and some like one is say a projected onto a two D plane, can we, can we figure out something,"
"Okay. Let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time, but let me ask you the internet question. So you're a physicist, you ask rigorous questions about the physics of a existence and these models of high assembly objects. Not when the internet would see an alien, they would ask two questions. One, can I eat it? And two, can I have sex with it? Yes. So internet is the internet is very sophisticated. So I'm prettier. So you kind of mentioned as very difficult, it's possible that we may not be even able to communicate with it,"
"This is a hopeful place. Yes. Do, do you think in terms of like interacting on this very primal level of, of sharing resources, like what would aliens eat? What would we eat? Would we eat the same thing with, could we potentially eat each other one, one person eats the other or are the aliens eat us? And the same thing with not sex in general reproduction, but genetically mixing stuff. Like, would we, would we be able to mix genetic information? Yeah."
So we'll have to find that shared history. We'll have to find the common ancestor in this causality map. <inaudible>
"That's really interesting. So say there's a lot of aliens out there in the universe. Each, each set of organisms would probably have like a number, you know, like Erdos number of like how far, like how far our common ancestor is. And so the close to the common ancestor, like it is on earth, the more like each other, the more likely we are to be able to have sexual reproduction, like sort"
"Yeah, exactly. Language communication."
"Boy. So it's communication, it's resources. I mean, that's the whole, and I think tied into that is the questions of like, who's going to harm who right. And actually definitions of whether the common ancestor proves. Yeah, this is very true. How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?"
"Well, so I have kind of a follow-up question, but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying about the way you're talking about human beings is you always say not to make yourself conscious about it. Cause I really, really enjoy it that you say we, yes, you don't say humans, you say, cause oftentimes like, you know, I don't know evolutionary biologists who kind of put yourself out as an observer, but you're, it's, it's kind of fascinating think that"
You as a human are struggling about your own origins.
"I think you just broke my brain with that question. Exactly. But that's Going to, yeah, that's a, that's a really clean formulation of a very fundamental question because you can only to understand cellular autonomy. You have to be inside of it, but as a human sort of a poetic romantic question, does it make you sad? Does it make you hopeful whether we're alone or not like in the different possible versions of that, if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe, does that give you at this moment in the causal chain, we have a future."
"Well, we definitely have a future. The question is where the future decreases the assembly. Like it could be where at the peak or we could be just,"
"So there could be a physics of a hope or a physics of optimism in there too, is that seems like also, I mean, optimism does seem to be a kind of engine that results in innovation. Yes. So this is like, why the hell are we trying to come up with new stuff?"
"Okay. That's talking about alien life out there in the universe, but you've also earlier in the conversation mentioned the shadow biosphere. So is it possible that we have weird life here on earth? That we're just not like even in a higher assembly formulation of life, the word just not paying attention to we're blind to by glyph we're potentially able to detect, but we're blind to, and maybe you could say, what is the shadow bias?"
"You think that's a serious possibility that we should explore with the tools of science, like be a serious effort?"
"And that, and that would lose the meaning of the word shadow bus. Right?"
"But then the question, it could be possible that there's like sufficiently distinct planets within one planet, meaning like environments within one planet. Like, I don't know, I've been looking recently because of having a chat with Catherine declare about IO, the moon of Jupiter. That's like all volcanoes and volcanoes a bad-ass, but like imagining like imagining life inside volcanoes, right? Like it seems like sufficiently chemically different, like to be living in the darkness where there's a lot of heat and maybe you could have different earth."
"It seems to me, at least the chemistry is a more powerful boundary then, then, then, and then geographic is just, seems like life finds a way literally to travel. So what do you think about all these UFO sightings? So to me it's really inspiring. It's yet another localized way to dream about the mysterious that is out there."
"I do think it's a, just as he said, a good way to psychologically and sociologically prepare ourselves to sort of like, what would that look like? And very importantly, which is what a lot of people talk about politically sort of a, there's this idea from the side came from the Soviet union of like the cold war. And we have to hide secrets in some way in us searching for life on other planets are searching for life in general, the, the way we've done government in the past, we tend to think of all new things as potential military secrets. So you want to hide them. And one of the ways that people kind of look at UFO sightings is like, like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff."
"Like what is the government hiding? I think that's a really, you know, in one sense it's a conspiratorial, but I"
"Think in another, it's an inspiration to change the way we do government to where secrets don't. Maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets as military secrets, but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff and see us as a human species as together in this whole search."
"And it's almost like a challenge to the way we've done stuff in the past in terms of keeping secrets when they're not. So like the first step, if you don't know how something, how something works, if there's a mysterious thing that the first instinct should not be like, let's hide it, let's put it in the closet so that the Chinese or the Russian government or whatever government doesn't, doesn't find it. Maybe the first one, the first instinct should be let's understand it, perhaps let's understand it together."
Yeah. The <inaudible> aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.
"Okay. We've in 2020 and still living through a pandemic setting, the, the, the, the political and all those kinds of things aside, I've always found viruses fascinating as, as live as dynamical systems. I was going to say living systems, but I've always kind of thought of them as living, you know, but that's a whole nother kind of discussion. Maybe, maybe it'd be great to put that on the table. One, do you find viruses beautiful slash terrifying and two, do you think they're living things or there's some aspect to them per our discussion of life that makes them living?"
"Most technology, whether it's viruses or AI that can scare scale in an exponential way, like kind of run, you know, like as opposed to like one thing makes another thing makes another thing is one thing makes two things. And those two things make four things. And then like that kind of process also seems to be fundamental to life. Yes. And it's terrifying because in a matter of, in a very short timescale, it can, if it's good at being life, whatever that is, it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life."
"And that's scary both for AI and for viruses. And it seems like understanding these processes that are underlying viruses. And I don't mean like on the virology or biology side, but on some kind of more computational physics perspective as we've been talking about seems to be really important to, to figure out how humans can survive right along with these kinds of oldest kind of life. And perhaps becoming a multi planetary species is, is a part of that. Like there's no, maybe like we'll figure out from a physics perspective as like there's no way Amy living system can be stable for prolonged period of time and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout."
"Like we have to multiply otherwise, anything that doesn't multiply exponential, we'll dive actually, maybe that's a fundamental law."
"That's really profound. That survival is just a nice little side-effect feature of maximizing creativity, but it doesn't need be there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really optimistic. I don't know if that's optimally that that could be terrifying to people because yeah, because you know, a system that maximizes creativity may very quickly get rid of humans for some reason, if it comes up with some other creative forms of existence. Yeah. But this is the AI thing is like the moment you have an AI system that can, that can flourish in the space of ideas or in some other space, much more effectively than humans."
"And it's sufficiently integrated into, into the physical space to be able to modify the environment."
"Yeah. The also the they'll AI will use our brains and some part to like, like ride, like accelerate the exchange of ideas. That's the neuro language dream is that, well, the humans will be still around. Cause you're saying architecture."
"Without controlling it, just observing."
"Hmm. Yeah,"
"Planetary scale phenomenon, but do you think an AGI is not distinct from humans were the whole package package comes as a planetary scale."
"Your packet of information that you've continually referred to as Sarah afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet. Are you afraid of death? Do ponder death, death have meaning in this process of creativity?"
"But isn't there something to fear about the fact that the way like the creative, the complexity of information it's been like created in you, the fact that it kinda breaks apart and disappears."
"Right. So you're, but that process of you at being not you anymore, that doesn't scare you. Of course it does the mystery of it. I mean the,"
As me
"So you can travel back in time. And that's comforting, like from a physics is concerned."
Comforting to me in terms of death with the flow of times. Not that does not.
"Do you think there's a certain sense in which the fear of death or the fear of non-existence maybe fear is not the right word is the actual, very phenomena that gives birth to existence. Like death is fundamental like this. It just feels like freaking out. Oh shit. That's right. Ends is actually like the, th th that's that's the thing that gives birth to this, this whole thing that like it's constantly is matter constantly freaking out about the back."
There's a desire to exist. Yeah.
And I don't know it any other way.
"See, I don't even know if I like existing. I think I really don't like not existing."
"Yes. Yeah. That's you, I, yeah."
"But like, I think those are like surface feelings there. It seems like there's something fundamental about wanting to exist."
"Speaking of future existence, is there advice you can give to future pockets of existences, AKA young people about life you've had, you've worn many hats you've taken on some of the biggest problems in the universe. Is there advice you can give to young people about life, about career, about existing, maybe not about the land?"
"We have. I've had a bunch of moments in my life where I've just been captivated by some beautiful phenomena. And I guess being rigorous about it and asking, what is the question underlying this from non phenomenon, like robots bring a smile to my face and for forming a question of like, why the hell is this so fascinating? Why is this specifically the human robot interaction question that something beautiful is brought to life when humans and robots interact, understanding that deeply as like, okay, so this is going to be my life work, then I don't know what the hell it is, but that, that's what I want to do."
"And doing that, doing that for whatever the hell gives you, that kind of feeling, I guess is the point. Yeah."
"Yeah. The, I think consciousness is created in the interaction between things. So the joy is in the creation of consciousness. And I really like the idea that it doesn't just have to be two humans creating costumes together. It could be humans and other entities. We talked offline about dogs and other pets and so on. There's a magic. I mean, I've been calling it love is this beauty of the human experience has created. And it just feels like fascinating that you could do that with a robotic system."
"Right. And there's something really powerful to me about engineering systems that allow you to create some of the magic of the human experience, because then you get to understand what it takes at least get inklings of what it takes to do to create consciousness. And I, I don't get this, you know, philosophers get really upset about this idea that sort of the illusion of cautiousness is consciousness. But I really liked the idea of engineering systems that fool you into thinking they're conscious, right? Because that's sufficient to create the magical experience because that's the interaction."
"Yes. The interaction. Yes. And this is the Russian hat I wear, which like, I think,"
"I think there's an ocean of loneliness in the world. I think we're deeply lonely. We're not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that. And I kind of think that's what love is between romantic love and friendship is two people kind of getting a little bit like, like alleviating for brief moment that loneliness that loneliness, but not, but we're not there. It's not the full aspect of that loneliness. Like we're desperately alone. We're desperately afraid of non-existing that I have that kind of sense. And I just want to explore that ocean of loneliness more when engineering like create a submarine that goes into the depth of that loneliness."
"So creating systems that can truly hear you truly listen, make the universal less lonely place. Exactly. Let me ask you about the meaning you've brought up, why the physics of white, what do you think is the meaning of our particular planets set of existences and the universe in general? The meaning of life."
"W H what, what is the, does the esky has the saying beauty will save the world. What does, is there a connection between creation and beauty? I think so. So is that like, are they, is beauty a correlate of creation?"
"Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it. I think this conversation was beautiful. Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me. I really, really appreciate it, Sarah, the honor. I hope we get a chance to talk again, and I hope like a machine to offline. We get a chance to talk with Lee. You guys have a beautiful, like intellectual chemistry. That's fascinating to listen to some, a"
Huge fan of both of you and I can't wait to see what you do next. Thanks so much. Great to be here. I am. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker and
"Check them out in a description to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Robert Frost. One of my favorite poets in three words, I can sum up everything I've learned about life. It goes on. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time."
"You should definitely consider signing up now because they are considering returning to being a regular sponsor of this podcast. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Michael malice. Hello, comrade. So animal farm by George Orwell is one of my favorite books."
"It's an allegory about at least I think about the Soviet union and the Russian revolution of 1917. So for people who haven't read it, it's animals overthrow the humans and then slowly become as bad or worse than the humans. So comrade, if we lived on this farm in the book animal farm, which animal would you most rather be? Would it be the pigs, the horses, the donkey Benjamin, the Raven, Moses, the humans, Mr. Mrs. Jones, the dogs or the sheep. I'm gonna go with the Milton answer, which is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven."
Right? It's better to rule in health and serve in heaven. So would have to
"At the very top. So the leader, the main pig Napoleon versus like the wallet of the other. Yeah,"
"Well, what was the nature of their opposition to totalitarianism? Is it basically freedom? Well, the value of freedom,"
"Okay. So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism or we look at the fictional animal farm, what's the heroic action then. So Khumbu joined the communist party. There's a bunch of different heroic actions, some more heroic than others, not just for the, you know, heroes, the wrong word in terms of like effectiveness. What's the effective action, I guess, is what I want to ask as a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind with the heroic action."
"It's a lot easier to be brave when it's just your skin. There's something when it's, when it's yeah. When it's your child, your, your loved ones, your every man becomes a coward."
"There is some aspect like the way I think about heroism is something that you said about the Nazi soldier, which is quietly privately in your own life, live the virtues that you want the rest of the world to live by. Yes. So like without I go writing about it is, is not as thorough cause living it quiet,"
"Is this some kind of weird passive, aggressive and direct way for you to tell me that I should take you off for your birthday on Monday. Is that why you gave that whole speech? That's that wasn't it at all? That was a joke."
Without failure. We would not have triumph. Can we stick on the camo absurdism versus existentialism? Sure. What do you think is the difference in your ideas about anarchism too? It seems like those are somehow intricately connected because existentialism is connected to freedom and freedom is connected to anarchism.
"It was probably against war in that same way. So I don't, I have to admit, I don't know much about the political side of Como"
"Well, how does that fit? Absurdism where everything is absurd. Nothing has meaning, you know, it really borders on nihilism."
"Well, I think there's beauty to be discovered in all of it and all of those experiences. Yes. So, but at the same time. So I often think about, I just recently re-read the idiot, but that's the Husky. I often feel like the idiot. That's why, when I say I'm an idiot, I often think about prince Michigan, that kind of idiot, which the world sees you as naive. I don't think he's naive. I don't think I'm naive, but I tend to see the good in people and the good in every moment. And the world often is cynical. And in fact, especially in what we do often, the intellectual is supposed to be cynical."
So the internet and people around me often will call me naive because I don't know
"I see even the word naive or the word innocent presumes that there's not wisdom in that presumes that somehow that's a,"
"Oh, isn't that beautiful to live that life of a child who sees the world with these bright eyes and is hopeful about the future, but just wait until they grow up and realize that reality is much harsher than they think. Right. But a child might be wiser than all of the adults in the room."
"Can we talk about world war II and the Soviet union? Sure. So on Sunday, June 22nd, 1941, Hitler launched operation Barbarosa, which was the surprise invasion of the Soviet union, right? If I could read to you a few lyrics from a song that for some reason it's stuck throughout my childhood, it was a famous song. During that time, lots of <inaudible> key have been beaten, numb BVD. The <inaudible> by <inaudible> shall be boys should not all do beach <inaudible> <inaudible> beach."
"The song talks about key of like that moment as part of that operation, that Kia was first bombed and it was announced then June 22nd, the song says at exactly four o'clock that the war has begun. For some reason, this song haunts me because the exactness of that time and this realization that at any moment you could have this thing happened to you in your own personal life. Maybe you had something like nine 11 happened where everything changes and it's just like commenting because it makes me think that at any moment, something like that could happen, that changes everything."
And I just think about like normal life going on in Kiev at the time. And then all of a sudden the bombs are dropping and they announced that the has begun.
And you thought you were going to stay out of the war.
"And there's no possibility to delude yourself. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because I mean, they, they would, as the song also talks about, but th they would burn the factories. So it was basically saying, we're in the war. Now, this is like, this is your life. Yeah. This is our life, you know?"
"Most of us are gonna just our life now is that most of us are going to die. And if we want to prevent all of us from dying, we, we have to fight."
Your kids without food and knowing they're not going to get the food.
"Yeah. There, I don't know what to make of the contrast that you were talking about. The fact that you've been truly happy the last few weeks and months. Yes. There've been a lot of moments of happiness and joy, and that joy"
"Is built on a history of human suffering. Like in your roots, in your blood is a lot of people that were tortured that suffered so that you could have this joy and you have both the, you have the responsibility to truly be grateful for that joy."
What's your takeaway about human nature from looking at North Korea and looking at how the rest of the world is looking at North Korea?
"Yeah. There's something especially disturbing about a weak man given power and just abusing that power. There's something about not just weak, but like mediocre at everything he does or less than mediocre."
"And every time I meet a person in this world,"
"Every time I meet a weird person, somebody to me heroism is also taking a risk to a rebel against mediocrity. Yeah. Like in, in the most simplest of ways, like the license address, like taking a risk to break the little bit of rule that nobody will know about to take that little bit of a leap of like that, that little protest against the bureaucracy."
"I mean like literally at the line at Starbucks or something like that. Like even in the tiniest of ways when I see people just like, it's almost like that little like glimmer in their eye, a wink like we're in this together. This there's, there's all this conformity all around us. That's at a different time could have been Nazi. Germany could have been a Stalinist Soviet union. We're in this together. We're going to rebel against that conformity by just, just taking the risk that a little bit of risk against mediocrity. I don't know. And that, and then once again, I see this in companies too. When I see the mediocrity, I see this, you know, I used to work at Google."
"I see it in Google. And when the companies grow that mediocrity is overwhelming. The Peter principle, right? The Peter principle. Yeah. My hope is that all of us have the possibility for that glimmer, that, that risk taking the leap of faith of whatever the heck. That is the leap out of the ordinary, out of the conformity, out of the mediocrity. So this is where you and I disagree. I think most, a lot of people do are not capable of that. They're accustomed to it. I don't know if they're not capable."
Thinking is involved. Or is it just taking that leap? There there's
"Something about that. Basic human spirit. Forget the thinking part. It's that? It's just saying like, I'll take that risk that taking that adventure, the same thing that got people to explore the seas, you know, the throughout human civilization, explore land, explore the oceans like that, Xplore exploration, like we've done stuff this way, all this time, I'm going to take a leap and that comes out of nowhere. So,"
I think almost everybody in the world can derive deep meaning and pleasure from having done those courageous acts. And I also think they have the capacity to do them to discover that meaning and happiness.
"They haven't gotten a chance to like, I've never tried LSD or DMT. You haven't gotten the chance to try this amazing journey, which is taking the risk"
"Chance to do a lot of things. And we don't realize there's a lot of stuff right in front of our nose that we don't realize, right. Cause you have to kind of wake up to it and sometimes you need the catalyst. There needs to be some kind of thing that happens that wakes you up. That the fact that most people don't take the small acts of rebellion doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to both do so. And to derive a lot of meaning from it. Then it's a discussion about how to create societies that get more and more people to be free actors and freethinkers."
"That's, that's the question that probably leads us into a discussion of anarchism and so on. But I just think we are very young as a species. We're trying to figure out how to get ourselves to first be collaborative, but at the same time, be free spirits. And I think both of those are within human nature."
"You know, my own flavor of a little bit of rebellion."
"Is, you know, you're very witty on Twitter and my, and Twitter likes mockery and wit and almost counter attack as a Twitter laws that somebody who's skilled at it, my own flavor of a bit of a rebellion is to say things very simply bordering and cliche with, with, with authenticity and like genuinely meaning the words I say. But knowing that those words would be, are easy to attack."
Sure. And that sometimes those attacks can hurt because people would just mock me. Sure.
"Cool. Yeah. So that, there's this pressure for me to be sound way more sophisticated, use bigger words, sometimes throw in a criticism of institutions or something like that. Like, like almost as if I have a deep wisdom about the way the world is broken, but when you speak very simply about beautiful things in life, it's very easy to sound like. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. And I kind of, I stick by that one. I don't know where is going to end up, but it's like the idiot from the CSK, it feels like that's the right. That's the right thing."
Even if it hurts when I'm attacked for it.
"And I hope every single time, there's no way"
"How you know, how hard"
"I don't know if it always can be mapped to that. I always wonder about them like what their motivations are. And I just kinda like whenever I think about them, I think only positively. And I don't even think about the childhood thing. I think, I don't know. I, I, I kind of imagined that all of us can go through that stage where we enjoy the division of others. We go through stages."
"No, the main, the main thing I would say is I'm way more popular than I deserve to be. What does deserve mean? The reality is there's people out there that just enjoy hating on others. And I think I don't, I don't fault them for it. Like I don't even think of them as haters. I think of them as just people that in this particular part of their life are enjoying this activity of, of deriving others on the internet. I'm not sure what to do with that. I just don't want to, I don't want to allow myself to think badly of them. I guess this is the thing"
"No, but are you saying they should stop hating? Cause I'm saying like, maybe they shouldn't just keep,"
"Want to point out why you do this to on Twitter. You want to point out the hypocrisy, the fraudulence of others."
"Yeah, I don't know. I, I don't know. I don't know what to make of it. Cause I think that there's a more generalist statement to be made. Like I see Twitter this way too. When I read a tweet, I try to read it with like the best possible interpretation. Meaning like, what is the wisdom in this tweet? Right. As opposed to what I think a large number of people, not a large number, but some fraction try to see what is the worst possible interpretation of this tweet. And they want to, they want to destroy you for that worst interpretation. Like they want to there's people I'm already aware of this with me. And certainly with a lot of people they're waiting for me to fail."
"They want me to be like, this guy talks about love all the time. Want me to be some dark, like a billion"
Counting can succeed. That bothers them. Yeah.
"Yeah. So anyone listening to this, they're annoyed by the look of my face. Remember that you could probably do it better than me and you should,"
"So what's the difference between joy and love Michael malice? I think joy is easier to,"
"I mean, example of joy, like w what was the moment of joy for, or recently"
"Going the wrong way. Doesn't every moment have the capacity to fill you with joy. Then the shitty moments and the good moments. But see, that's the way I usually talk about love is like, I love life. Yes. And in, because life can generate every, everything, the pain, the loss, but also just like simple or complicated bliss. All of that. I just love all of that and that, because it fills me with a kind of, I guess, joy, but joy has a connotation that it's supposed to be somehow positive. Like you're supposed to be smiling to me."
"You know, man's search for meaning Viktor Frankl, you know, just it's, you're, you're in the Holocaust, you're in a concentration camp. Just having a little bit of food that you didn't expect you will have, or even just thinking about food."
"Yeah. So to me, like all of like life is like infinitely full of possibility for joy. And that's what I mean by luck, because oftentimes like romantic love is what people think about when they think well, but to me, it's all like part of the same thing. And it's almost like, love romantic love or love with a friend. Friendship is like, you both notice each other. It's like dogs. They look at each other, and then they look at the thing they're interested in. You both notice each other. And that moment of joy, you share that moment of joy together. Like the restaurant, the restaurant. Yeah. If you're both, almost without conspiring, notice the absurdity of how shitty this meal is."
"And, and like that again, that little glimmer of realization. That's, that's what makes life beautiful. You mentioned your grandmother and love, you were thinking of returning there. The plans got a little bit delayed, but what are you hoping from that trip of going back to Russia, going back to Ukraine, what do you hope to get out of it? But what do you think you will feel"
Which way are you similar?
"He bench more than you or, oh yeah,"
"He's just cuisine. He's so good looking. He could be one of those guys. Who's mostly biceps, right?"
"So he's perfect in every way. That's great. He, he flaws does he have, cause I need,"
You've assembled a number of essays from anarchist thinkers and a new book called the anarchist handbook. Yeah. You mentioned Emma Goldman. What interesting things do these thinkers agree on@whatdotheydisagreeontheanarchisthandbook.com
So maybe it's useful to talk about a few contrasts and in there.
"So one is a Leo Tolstoy. Oh yeah. Who I think not many people know is an anarchist. Yes. A Christian and Christian anarchist. Yeah. So he came to despise government for his deceit and its violence. But to him, the Christian principles of nonviolence I think are important. Oh yeah. And it's kind of pacifist kind of mindset of,"
"Back. So he's in that way, at least I've read, he influenced MLK and Gandhi. What do you think about this flavor? Color of the anarchist flag of nonviolence, nonviolent opposition?"
"Well, that was a for him, from the individual perspective, perhaps he, he calls that Christian, but listening to that voice of conscience, like whatever that is in you. So for Tulsa, it seems like anarchism from the individual perspective is a silencing the rest of the world and listening to the, the, for him, probably God given voice of conscience. Yes. And so that, that's what it means to live embody anarchism"
"Would say he would see those as basically this, correct? Yeah. So terms of"
"Forms of government, the Christian government is one that's no government. Correct. What do you think about that as advice for an individual turn the other cheek, do you think? I tend to believe that that's a really good way to live."
Exactly. Do you think that's ultimately a good way to implement anarchy in your personal life?
"I think you then have to take a case by case like there's so many human interactions that are required for life and there's tension and all those kinds of things. It's not always,"
"I think there's a ways of dealing with the tensions that are natural to human interactions. That can't be simply, you know, it's not as simple as saying, you want to respect the freedom of others and the, the boundaries of others. It's like, you both have to agree on stuff and work something out. And the mechanisms of that agreement, the game theory of that agreement requires different hacks and strategies. And the, the, the question is for an anarchist collective that's, well-functioning what kind of hacks, what kind of ways of behavior are more likely to be productive and not, you know, that that's almost like the question."
"Do you want to turn the other cheek? Or do you want to stand your ground really firmly when somebody is an asshole to you, you walk away or when somebody is an asshole to you turn the other cheek and give them a chance to rise to the best version of themselves and then find a common ground kind of thing. It's a, it's an open question of how to form those collectives. When there's people with difficult childhoods and the all that kind of stuff,"
"Yeah. And, and that's, I mean, I don't think anyone has the answer to this question is, is that the right strategy to me game theoretically, it seems the right strategy is to,"
"For one it's perfectly rational actors. But when you have, I mean, there's noise. That, that, there's a, I think benefit to just, even if they keep being shitty to you, still being nice to them"
"But isn't that a fundamentally anarchist question of how we figure out this puzzle of human complexities in order to form voluntary collectives. Like we have to figure that out. How to make people feel good, how to make people"
"Right? I feel like I should try to argue against anarchism at some point out of love, out of love. And so, because people out of joy that people enjoy seeing me, what is it when like Ben Shapiro's argues against like a 20 year old feminist <inaudible> is this video of Michael Miles destroys a Marxist Russian communist pig. So anarchism as opposed to,"
"So do you think it's possible that humans when left on their own accord, they form hierarchies now"
"Right. So I guess there's a certain sense in which we're living in an anarchism now. And I don't mean just like, because the nations, as you've said, are in anarchism relative to each other, but isn't the United States, just a collective that was formed in anarchy. And this is just the collective that we're operating under this hierarchy that was naturally formed."
So in what way is the United States imposing by force something on you? Do you think
Don't you have the freedom to not operate under that.
"But you have the freedom to live under the United States or not. So, so even"
"Right. Not necessarily leave like geographically, but there's, there's ways to live outside the force of the United States. There's ways it's just very difficult to operate that way."
"So is it possible that every hierarchy that gets big enough and successful enough such that it can monopolize a bunch of services it provides? Isn't it always going to be a moral in your sense, the way the United States government is amoral?"
"So like won't every,"
"But your sense is that there'll be less and less over time. Jeff Bezos's like, whatever industry will look at this, be less. There's a trend towards decentralization across all industries."
"At the same time. It does following on your argument, it does seem easier to move an immigrate from, from state to state within the United States and to other countries. Do you think that's a form of freedom that embodies anarchism, where you can resist the, the force of state by choosing where you live to"
"So I guess I'm trying to get to the difference between the state and what you would naturally want an anarchy, which is like a security company. Sure. All of those things they will, as they become successful, start looking more and more like the state because you get to elect, you give them money. They, they, I got, you have leaders. What's the difference between a government and a very successful service provider in, in anarchism,"
"Is it possible that to reframe? So Jeff Bezos does, if he, if he hires a security force, right? Also, is it possible to reframe taxation as a form of payment? Like it, if it was done much better, if you could pay this collective that we call government in ways where you could pay for things that you care for so much, your money would be much more directly contributing to the things you care for. Whether you, if you care for a service like healthcare, you'll be able to buy essentially insurance from the government."
"I guess I know on the surface level, I'm trying to get deeply to say there's a lot of similarities, but"
"So the government provides a lot of services in the current system, right?"
"That's a hypothesis. That's very likely. No, that's not the second demonstration."
"Yeah, I think of the government is a kind of subscription service."
"Hates when you, you sign up to a gym and then you realize in the contract, it's very difficult to cancel that a membership. And then they upped the price. I mean, that's, there's a lot of unpleasant things with, with a, with a subscription service that then you can elect to go to another subscription service,"
"Well, this, we can talk about that too. So you're saying Yelp is more effective than a voting. Yes. The thing is, I agree with you, but you go take a further step. You say that Yelp has ethical and moral and voting is a moral or like not voting, but government isn't moral. So like it's not only is one more efficient than the other. You're saying like, cause I would say government sucks at doing what it does and has gotten a lot better at it. And I believe it can get, keep getting better as it gets smaller. And you leverage these companies more and more, but you're saying no, no, no."
"Government is fundamentally as an idea, gets in the way of companies that should be doing those things anyway. Right. I, I just think that companies, when you take away, government will start looking like government. They,"
"Right? The, the basic objection you have with government, because you can leave. Like I, I apologize that this is that stupid Twitter cliche statement, but your opposition to the, this idea of leaving the United States is that it's just, it's a lot of effort. It's too much"
"But to operate large organizations like you see this with cryptocurrency there's governance, you have to make difficult decisions. There's a block size wars for Bitcoin. Sure. So you will, there is a voting mechanism often with membership when you're subscription service."
"No, I literally mean vote in his case, not money. There's some decisions like should Bitcoin have increases block size. Okay. There's a bunch of different. Th they're called soft forks or hard forks."
"But you're saying that's the fundamental property of the state. I have a sense that the state could become as effective as what we think of as companies. I mean, th th this is why"
"So the price is a really strong signal that allows you to, to operate a voluntary collective, where people get what they want and don't get what they don't want,"
"Voluntarily, but the word government, I just think it's possible to have collectives that of, of human beings that represent others based on their voluntary. They go, yes, of course you have private governance, private governance,"
"Yeah. But then you, I just, it starts to look very similar to me. A successful private governance mechanism at a scale of the United States starts looking a whole lot. Like the current government of the United States. What's"
"Close to the sidewalks size wise or budget wise or power wise? No. So you're saying you just, it's not even state. It's almost like anything at that size. You want to keep things smaller."
"That to me is actually unclear. We don't know that to be true, where that Google or Amazon can't grow to the size. If you take away the U S government, I'm not sure, sure that Amazon can't grow to the size of the cake."
That's not worst case scenario. <inaudible>
"That's not the concern. I'm saying like, this is what it looks like when Google is the federal government. It's not like, it's like, to me, the us government is our best attempt. So far to have large scale representation of people's interests. It really sucks. But it's our best attempt so far. And the question is called to improve it. Like if you take away all the, if you take away the us government, I'm trying to see how do we improve on that level? That scale of representation of people's rights."
"So what I would, you're going to criticize this, but I believe the government is like the parenting thing we've talked about earlier. I think it creates a safe space for gov for safe spaces."
"People to be safe, but for a safe space for entrepreneurship. So I believe that got good government. Hanusa gimme a sec. Give me a secretary. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I think government gives opportunity for companies to out-compete it?"
"So I believe you need to have private school government to give a chance for ups FedEx for space X. Oh, it was an accident there to, to, to pop up and then government will naturally back off from that place. So like you, but you need the innovators step in and build the thing. Okay."
"I bet. Well, w from, from, from what? From a FedEx and ups, from a space X, from Amazon, hold on"
"I think there just has to be a, of course you can do a complete without government, but government is here."
"The question is that safety net that's needed for entrepreneurship that's needed for, I'm sorry to say, but I have a sense that there needs to be a bit of a safety net for freedom."
So would a engagement in military conflict be one of the biggest negative things about the state to you?
"See, I think that there's value from small government that doesn't engage in more. As I do think that the kind of collectives that you imagine functioning well would look like the best version of government that I imagine. So I stayed endorsement. Why I see them as the,"
I think a lot of that is just terminology.
"I have no problem with that or anything really? Because like I said, life is beautiful, but nevertheless, you wrote the essay why I'm not, not going to vote this time or ever that I won't vote this year or any other year or any year. And the basic idea"
"I'll read it in Russian, then pay somebody to translate it."
"Like your basic summary is, let me see if pressed, the simplest explanation I have for refusing to vote is this. I don't vote for the same exact reasons that I don't take communion, no matter how admirable he is or how much I agree with him, the Pope, isn't the steward over my soul, nor is any president, the leader of my life. This does not make me ignorant or evil any more than not being a Christian makes me ignorant to evil. If I need representation, I will hire the most qualified person to do so. Yeah. Isn't voting our current best developed way of hiring the most qualified person to represent you on some things."
"No,"
"In governance again? That's what Bitcoin is. You want to be represented in deciding what to do, but"
"So listen, I agree with this aspect very much. So though, we should be voting for ideas and issues, not voting for leaders for, for leaders to represent this across the full spectrum of issues. Right. It seems to make no sense. Okay, good. This is great. But I do think there should be a leader. I do believe in voting for representatives to debate, to be communicators of ideas to us,"
"Exactly. And, but, but also, I mean, I do like the idea of voting for certain people to debate certain ideas, right? That's a major improvement, but the final vote should be based on the idea. So, okay. So we agree. That would be nice to have plus no wars. And then, then you'll stop tweeting. So aggressive."
"And the same thing with drugs, heroin, cocaine. Do you crack, do you, the people that need help the most are the ones who are addicted to those drugs,"
"Yeah, I have."
"Yeah. I, I tend to believe, I usually don't speak so negatively about politicians, but I do think that politicians have done more evil in the war on drugs. Then did the people that are supposed to be the criminals."
"So in contrast to Tolstoy, let me ask you about it. I'm a Goldman, you wrote that if anarchism believed in rulers, then Emma Goldman would be the undisputed queen. Yes. What ideas to find her flavor of anarchism?"
"There's the violence. I mean, she was more open to the idea of violent opposition versus somebody like Tolstoy."
"You know, access. Is there somebody you left out from the book that you thought about leaving in like some interesting figures?"
"Is there some people that you think the public would be surprised to learn that they are at least in part and a kiss? Like I saw that Howard's in is supposed to be an anarchist. I mean, is there like, just like Tolstoy is an anarchist, is there some people like that? They think in our modern life that would be surprised to learn their anarchists."
"Sure. And I mean, I guess there's a lot of groups like the libertarians, for example, should have some element of that. Oh sure. For sure of harsh questioning of the ways of government"
You Michael malice in many ways are a nuisance.
"Nevertheless, you decided to move to Austin. Yes. Why do you think you're moving to Austin?"
Or why do you moving both to Austin and away from New York
"What this is is I made sure that's fronting month to month. Oh, this is rental. This is rental. Well, you didn't realize this. I thought you bought this. No, no, no, no. This is rental Hawk. Y I thought you'd"
"But he in the implementation of freedom is different for everybody. For me, I don't want to make a statement about others. I'll just speak for myself. I think when you buy a house that is not just a wise financial decision or all those kinds of reasons that people have investment, all those kinds of things. I think it's also a hit on your freedom because the positive way to frame that as you make it a home, you have a deep connection to it. But the negative way to frame it is you're now a little bit stuck there, and you may stay there way longer than you should when much better opportunities for life come up."
"There's there's stages in life when you're not sure exactly what the future will hold. I would argue. That's very often the case basically at every stage in life. And I just want to make sure I maximize the freedom to, to embrace the most ambitious, the, the craziest, the wildest, the most beautiful opportunities that come by. You've actually brought this up because I said, I really enjoyed the conversation with UN Juran. Yeah. Like you talking to you and somebody else. I think you make a really significant effort. You've said this before, but it really is true. And it stands in contrast to other folks who are also good conversations."
"You really make an effort for that person, like to like to meet the person. Oh, for sure. And that's a, you make me, you made me realize it's kind of a, it's an art form, but it's also just, it's a thing worth doing, of putting in that effort and that leap of humanity to, to like reach to whether you're talking to Dave Rubin or Alex Jones or Joe, or me just, yeah, those are different human beings and they're taking that leap. It's fascinating. I mean, do you have, how do you think about that?"
Yeah. I really enjoyed that conversation with her. I was surprised by the dislikes and all that
"Push back. And there was great humor there. You're both a bit of trolls in very different ways, but nevertheless, that connection, the humor and the mutual respect and love is all there. Yeah. It's just fascinating. You've talked to Alex Jones a couple of days ago. Sure. Yeah. He's talked to him many times before, but you've had him on your podcast this week. Yeah. This week I was kinda surprised that he mentioned that human-animal hybrids was like the number, the main conspiracy that people should look into to open their eyes to the, you know, to all this, to the globalists, to all the conspiracies that are out there."
Was that surprising to you?
"Really good. It was only an hour, but it was a very good conversation. Yeah."
"Well, I like this, this thing he said before. And that's what makes me the most interested in Alex is the, the Nietzsche quote about the, you know, gazing into the abyss. I think he said on your show that he has become the best or something like that. I think that makes him fascinating that when you really take conspiracy theory, seriously, the kind of effect it has on your mind. That to me is fascinating."
"I, I, unfortunately the same problem applies with language applies to a lot of other areas,"
"That could be fixed by coming up with different words to, to label conspiracy theories that are much more likely to be true. Yeah."
"Well, this is the black pill versus white pill question with the abyss. Do you think thinking about these things can, can destroy the mind, can make you deeply cynical about the world."
"You mentioned that you've been doing a lot of amazing things. Been truly joyful recently. Yeah. What, I don't know if you have a bucket list, is there items on the bucket list you haven't done yet, or are you pretty much satisfied and happy? And if you die today, I, if I murder you, you'll be happy. I could die today. Is there an item on the bucket list you want to get done?"
"Michael, there were, there will be two really big names that wanting to do this podcast will do this podcast that I considered to do episode 200 with. But then I realized, why the hell talk to somebody I'm famous when I could talk to somebody I love that nobody knows or cares for"
I listed all the Russians. I know. And who is the easiest to get?
"Yeah. Yeah. And it turned out. Okay. I think slightly above average, Michael, I love you. You're an incredible human being. It's an honor that you would talk to me and you'll be my friend. Thanks so much for doing this."
"Let's be done. Yeah. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael malice and thank you to gala games, indeed better help and masterclass check them out in the description to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Jack Kerouac that perhaps begins to explain the nature of, and the reasons for my friendship with Mr. Michael malice. The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live Matt, to talk Matt, to be saved desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say commonplace thing, but burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars."
"And then the middle, you see the blue, central light pop. And everybody goes, thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. <inaudible>."
"This is Alex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation will Yosha Bach Thank you for once again, coming on to this particular Russian program and sticking to the theme of a Russian program, let's start with the darkest of topics"
"So this is inspired by one of your tweets. You wrote that quote when life feels unbearable, I remind myself that I'm not a person. I am a piece of software running on the brain of a random ape for a few decades. It's not the worst brain to run on. Have you experienced low points in your life? Have you experienced depression?"
So you're like a leaf floating down the river. You're just have to accept that there's a river and you just float.
How much product can we actually do of the elephant
Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor.
"So everything outside of that consciousness is the elephant. So it's the physics of the universe, but it's also society that's outside of your,"
"So can you, is the agent a single human being? What's what, which object has agency?"
"So, but the models or the agents,"
"Still don't understand. What's the best way to think of which objects has agency with respect to human beings. Is it the body? Is it the brain? Is it the contents of the brain as agency? Like what's the actuators that you're referring to? What is the controller and where does it reside? Or is it these impossible things? Cause I keep trying to ground it to time the three-dimensional space and the one dimension of time. What's the agent in that for humans,"
"Okay. So it's hierarchies have to go to another one of your tweets with, I think you were playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins with saying his brains all the way down. So it's like it's agents all the way down it's agents made up of agents made up of agents. Like if <inaudible> Germany in Germany has made up a bunch of people and the people are themselves agents in some kind of context. And then people are made up of cells, each individual. So is it agents all the way down?"
"Can I ask you a personal question? What's the line between life and non-life is personal because you're a life form. So what do you think in this emerging complexity at which point does the things that are being, living and have agency"
"Yeah. So there's information and there's a wall to protect to, to, to maintain this disequilibrium, but isn't this very earth centric, like what you're referring to as,"
"It a so useful for conversation, but is it somehow fundamental to the university? You think there's a actual line to eventually be drawn between life and non-life or is it all kind of continuum?"
What about non-living systems? Is it also a machine? Yeah.
"Not, not only do we not know, I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise. I always worry that we, we look at the world too narrowly. Like we have, there could be life of a very different kind, right under our noses that we're just not seeing because we're not either limitations of our cognitive capacity or we're just not open-minded enough either with the tools of science or just the tools of our mind."
"Yeah. But I wonder about time, time, scale, and scale, spatial scale, whether we just need to open up our idea of what, like how life presents itself. It could be operating at a much slower timescale. Yeah. Much faster timescale. And it's almost sad to think that there's all this life around us that we're not seeing, because we're just not like thinking in terms of the right of the right scale, both time and space."
Hmm. Entities of sufficiently high complexity that are full of surprises?
I don't have a free world. So that just came out of my mouth. I'm not sure if that even makes sense. There's certain characteristics. So complexity seems to be an unnecessary property of life. And I almost want to say it has ability to do something unexpected.
Yes.
"Yeah. Increasing. I mean, there there's, there seems to be some kind of universal drive towards increasing pockets of complexity. I don't know what that is. That seems to be like a fundamental, I don't know if it's a property of the universe or it's just the consequence of the way the universe works, but there seems to be this small pockets of emergent complexity that builds on, on top of each other and starts having like greater and greater complexity by having like a hierarchy of complexity, like little organisms, building up a little society that then operates almost as an individual organism itself. And all of a sudden you have a Germany and a Merkel."
"That I feel like that's a gradual beautiful process. Like it's almost no fall is a process akin to evolution. And the way it comes down is not the same way came up. The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly. So usually there's some kind of catastrophic,"
"But that's would that be, would you classify this as a decrease in complexity though? Yes."
"Do you have a sense of where we are? Are we on the exponential rise or we're at the peak? Are we the down slope of the, the United States empire?"
"I think that's probably the definition of like optimism and cynicism. So my nature of optimism is I think we're on the rise,"
"I think there's just all a matter of perspective. Nobody knows, but I do think that erring on the side of optimism, like you need a sufficient number, you need a minimum number of optimists in order to make that up thing actually work. And so I tend to be on the side of the optimist."
"See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers that have become domesticated cats. Do you use a different metaphor as I'm not exactly sure where so destructive or just softer and nicer and lazier,"
"Ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys, not"
"You seem to have a little bit more of a structure, but it's a different, different part of the tree."
"You mentioned the elephant and the, the monkey riding the elephant and a consciousness is the monkey. And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do. And sometimes the elephant listens. I heard you got into some content. Maybe you can correct me, but I heard you got into some contentious freewill discussions. Is this with Sam Harris or something like that? Not that I know of. Some people in club paws told me, you made a, a bunch of big debate points about freewill. Well, let me just then ask you where, where in terms of the monkey and the elephant, do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will, how much control does the monkey have?"
"But what about for you? So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata, where it's deterministic, but when you squint your eyes a little bit, it starts to look like there's agents making decisions at the higher. So when you zoom out and look at the entities that are composed by the individual cells, even though the there's a underlying simple rules that make the system evolve in deterministic ways, it looks like there's organisms making decisions is that where the illusion of free will emerges at jump and scale"
Right? So for you then free wills and illusion.
"The another word for model is what story. So it's the story you're telling. I mean, do you actually have control? Is there a such a thing as a U and is there such a thing as you have in control? So like, are you manifesting your evolution as a, as an entity"
Okay.
"So how's that not an illusion, the story is written then, or rather we're not the writers of the story."
"No, we don't know that. When did we know that,"
"Yep. But you know, when you play video games, I understand that what's actually happening is zeros and ones inside of, inside of a computer instead of a CPU and GPU. But you're still seeing like a, the rendering of that. And you're still making decisions whether to shoot, to turn left or to turn right. If you're playing a shooter or every time it started thinking about Skyrim and elder scrolls and walking around and beautiful nature and swinging a sword, but it feels like you're making decisions inside that video game. So even though you don't have direct access in terms of perception to the, the bits, to the zeros and ones, it still feels like you're making decisions and your decisions are actually feels like they're being applied all the way down to the zeros and ones."
"So it feels like you have control, even though you don't have direct access to reality."
"Yes. But I feel like I have control inside the video game. Like the, all those like 12 year olds that kicked my ass on the internet."
How close is it to the real world though?
"Like very consistent we're we're, you're seeing a very, a crude approximation. Isn't our dream world, very consistent, like to the point of being mapped directly one-to-one to the actual physical world, as opposed to, as being completely tricked this. This is like, where you have like that."
"Yeah. So we can act in that dream world and our actions have impact in the, in the real world, in the physical world too, which we don't have access. Yeah."
"So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control? Do we have, so freewill is having a conscious, being free will, is the monkey being able to steer the elephant?"
"But it's a really good approach. It's a really good interface. And approximation equals MC squared is a good equations, are good approximation for what they're much better approximation. So to me, waves is a really nice approximation of what's all the complexity that's happening underneath. Basically it's a measure learning that is constantly"
"Are we talking about, which is the machine learning, our perception system or the dream world"
"What about the fact that like, when you're standing w with the water on your feet, and you're looking out into the vast, like open water of the ocean, and then there's a beautiful sunset and it, it, well, the fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have like friends or loved one with you and like, you feel love. What does that as the dream world? Or what is that?"
See the word dream makes it seem like it's not real
"Only thing that's real to you is the thing that's happening at the very base of reality, like"
"So what, what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument that it doesn't have to be consistent? The dream world to the, the, the, what he calls like the interface to the actual physical reality, where there could be evolution. I think he makes an evolutionary argument, which is like, it could be an evolutionary advantage to have the dream world drift away from physical reality."
"In some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure in the animal kingdom."
"Do you have a sense of what is that base layer? Physical reality? You have like a, so you have these attempts at the theories of everything. The very, very small of like strength theory or what Stephen Wolf from talks about with a hyper grass. These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects. And then there is more like quantum mechanics. That's talking about objects that are much larger, but still very, very, very tiny. Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is? That is like at the lowest level, the turtle at the very bottom, you have a sense."
Yeah. That that could be just a peculiar cork of human cognition that we like discrete discrete makes sense to us. Infinity doesn't sort of in terms of our intuition.
"Hmm. How much, how important is this distinction between discrete and continuous for, for you to get to the cause? There's a, I mean, in discussion of your favorite flavor of the theory of everything, there's a few on the table. So there's string theory. There's there's particular, there's a loop quantum gravity,"
"Which focused on one particular unification. There's, there's just a bunch of favorite flavors of different people trying to propose a theory of everything, Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history. And then of course, Stephen Wolfram, who I think is one of the only people doing a discreet,"
"Yeah. He, he, he talks about that. There's the human mind can do certain mathematical things. The computer as defined by the universal Turing machine can not. Yes. What so that it has to do with infinity."
"Do you think he's right on, so let's, let's leave his discussion of consciousness aside for the moment. Do you think he's right about just what he's basically referring to as so are, is the human mind fundamentally more capable as a thinking machine than a universal toy machine? No, but so he's suggesting that, right?"
Yeah. It can do the kind of computation the machine cannot
"What about his idea? That consciousness is more, more than a computation. So it's more than something that a Turing machine can can do. So again, saying that there's something special about our mind, they cannot be replicated in a machine."
"The basic statement is there's a, there's a human experience. That includes intelligence. That includes self-awareness. That includes the hard problem of consciousness. And the question is, can that be fully simulated in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer, as we understand it today, Roger Penrose says no. So the, the university tour machine can not simulate the universe."
"And I mean, just, just, just to linger on it, like you see, okay. Yeah. It's in the perceptual language, the multimodal perceptual language, that's the experience. That's what consciousness is within that. Well, then that model will not story, but do you, do you have agency when you play a video game, you can turn left and you can turn right in that story. So in that dream world, how much control do you have? Is there such a thing as you in that story? Like, is it right to say the main character, you know, everybody's NPCs and then there's the main character and you're controlling the main character, or is that an illusion?"
"Is there a main character that you're controlling? I'm getting to the point of like the freewill point,"
"But there's the hard problem of consciousness, which I would also, there's a subjective experience of freewill as well, that I'm not sure where the robot gets that, where that little leap is because for me right now, everything I imagine with that robot, as it gets more and more and more sophisticated, the agency comes from the programmer of the robots, still of what was programmed in,"
"If we define hyper-parameters broadly. So it's not just the S the, the parameters, the control this end to end learning system, but the entirety of the design of the robot, like the there's, you have to remove the human completely from the picture. And then in order to build the robot, you have to create an entire universe because you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution. You have to go from the very beginning in order for it to have, because I feel like there's always a human pulling, the strings, and that makes it seem like the robot is cheating, is getting a shortcut to consciousness."
"Okay. So let's go there. Cause I got to talk to you about this. So obviously with the case of Boston dynamics, as you may or may not know, it's always either hard-coded or remote controlled, there's no intelligence."
"We have to separate several levels of discussions here. So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control, not with no machine learning in order to be, to maintain balance or to write itself. It's a control problem in terms of using the actuators to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing that's uneven how to always maintain balance. And there's a tricky, like set of heuristics around that, but that's the only goal. Everything you see Boston dynamics doing in terms of that to us, humans is compelling, which is any kind of higher order movement, like turning a wiggling it's, but like, you know, jumping back and it's two feet dancing."
"The dancing is even worse because dancing is hard coded in it's it's choreographed by humans, this choreography software. So like there is no of all that high level movement. There's no anything that you can call, certainly can't call AI, but there's no even like basic heuristics, it's all hard coded in. And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them, which is"
"So those two layers are separate the, the thing, the higher level instruction of what, how you should move and where you should move."
"Right. But see, it doesn't feel like freewill. Okay."
"I just don't know how big of a leap it is to start create a system. That's able to tell stories within stories like how big of a leap that is we're currently Boston dynamics is, or any robot that's operating in the physical space that, and that lead might be big if it requires to solve the hard problem of consciousness, which is telling a hell of a good story, right?"
"I, yeah, I think I would need to get into details because I think the way he uses the word consciousness is more kin to like, self-awareness like modeling yourself within the world, as opposed to the subjective experience. The hard problem."
"We are the thing that pays attention. Right. I don't see where the awareness that we're aware, the, the heart problem doesn't feel like it's solved. I mean, there, there, there it's called a hard problem for a reason, because it seems like there needs to be a major leap."
A space exist inside the story. Okay. So your consciousness
"So what about the perception of consciousness? So to me, you look conscious. So the illusion of cautiousness, the demonstration of consciousness, I asked for the, the leg of robot, how do we make this leg of the robot conscious? So there's two things, and maybe you can tell me if they're neighboring ideas. One is actually making a conscious and the other is make it appear conscious to others. Are those related,"
"But then I can come back to a conscious state. Okay. I particularly I'm referring to the social aspect that the demonstration of consciousness is a really nice thing at a party when you're trying to meet a new person. It's a nice thing to, to, to know that they're conscious and they can, I dunno how fundamental consciousness is in human interaction, but it seems like to be at least an important part. And I, I asked that in the same kind of way for robots, you know, in order to create a rich, compelling human robot interaction, it feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness within that interaction."
"The question is, how hard is it for the robot artificially created robot to achieve cat level and party tricks? Yes."
So you need the unified model to do the party
"So what's the process. Would you save engineering consciousness in the machine? Like a, what are the ideas here?"
"You build a very accurate prediction mechanism that is step one of the perception. So first you predict, then you perceive and see the error in your prediction."
"So you're, you're talking about building a hell of an awesome perception system. That's able to do prediction and perception and correct. Then"
"And you were saying, the motivational system is some kind of like, what is it, a high level narrative over some lows?"
"Like motivational system, like the lower level stuff like hungry. Yes."
So cautiousness the index
"And the memory database. Okay. But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness a little further. So we usually relate suffering to consciousness. So the capacity to suffer, I think to me, that's a really strong sign of consciousness is a thing that can suffer. How, how is that useful suffering? And like in your model where you just described, which is indexing of memories and what does it coherence with the perception with this predictive thing that's going on in the perception?"
"How, how does the suffering relate to any of that? You know, the higher level suffering that humans do,"
"So at least to grow with you adding extra layers it's okay. Do your cognition, let me ask you then, cause I guess take on suffering the ethics of the whole thing. So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others you've tweeted. One of my biggest fears is that insects could be conscious. The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable. So when we think of other conscious beings is suffering a property of consciousness that we're most concerned about."
"So I'm still thinking about robots, how to make sense of other non-human things that appear to have the depth of experience that humans have. And to me, that means consciousness and the darkest side of that, which is suffering the capacity to suffer. And so I started thinking how much responsibility do we have for those other conscious beings? That's where the, the definition of consciousness becomes most urgent, like having to come up with a definition of cautious because the most urgent is who should we, and should we not be torturing?"
"Well, he, he drew, he drew a line somewhere where this is us and that's them, it's the circle of empathy. It's like these, you don't have to use the word consciousness, but these are the things that matter to me if they suffer or not. And these are the things that don't."
I see. So like different societies throughout history put different value on the
"Even the, the objective of avoiding suffering. Like some societies probably. I mean, this is where like religious belief really helps that, that afterlife, that doesn't matter that you suffer or die will matters as you suffer honorably, right? So that you enter the afterlife."
"Somebody who who's saying, we live in a dream world, zero evidence for anything. So it's okay."
"Just because we live in a dream world, doesn't mean mathematics can give us a consistent glimpse of physical of objective."
"Can I ask you on a small tangent to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people which is postmodernism,"
"What is, what is postmodernism? How would you define it and why to you? Is it not a useful framework of thought?"
It becomes. Yeah. It becomes a political weapon of sorts. Yeah.
"Right? You have to acknowledge the ideological part of any movement actually, including postmodernism."
"Right? So, I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology that make it harmful. One of them is that like dogmatism of just certainty, dog-eared certainty in that you're right. You have the truth and nobody else knows"
"Can I ask you about substances chemical substances that affect the video game, the dream world. So psychedelics that increasing have been getting a lot of research done on them. So in general, psychedelics psilocybin, MGMA, but also really interesting one, the big one, which is DMT, what, and where are the places that these substances take the mind that is operating in the dream world? Do you have an interesting sense how this throws a wrinkle into the prediction model? Is it just some weird little quirk or is there, is there some fundamental expansion of the mind going on?"
"W what is it about psychedelics that forces that I thought it would be the opposite? I thought, I thought that is, it's a good mechanism for, for generalization, for regularization. So it feels like psychedelics expansion of the mind, like taking you outside of like forcing your model to be a non predictive is a good thing. Meaning like, it's, it's almost like, okay, what I would say psychedelics are akin to is traveling to a totally different environment like going, if you've never been to like India or something like that from the United States, very different set of people, different culture, different food, different roads, and values and all those kinds of things."
"Yeah. But doesn't give you a fresh perspective on the physical reality. Who's making that sound is inside my head, or is it external?"
"Yeah. In the physical reality, there's there's sound waves traveling through air. Okay. That's our model of what's happened, how it happened, right. It doesn't the dose psychedelics give you a fresh perspective on this physical reality, like on not this physical reality, but this, this more w what do you call it? The dream world that's mapped directly."
"Oh, isn't it another trickier form of data augmentation."
"I, I think I'm over applying the metaphor of a neural network in my own mind, which I just think that doesn't lead to over-fitting. Right. But, but you were just sort of anecdotally saying my experiences with people that have done psychedelics or that, that, that kind of quality,"
"What you mean by overfitting? Now there's a lot of interpretation to the term overfitting in this case, but I got you. So he was getting, he was getting a positive rewards from a lot of actions."
"I wonder, you know, there's a question of correlation versus causation. And also wonder if it's the psychedelics, or if it's more the social, like being the outsider and having a strong community of, of outside and being, having a leadership position in and outside of cult-like community that could have a much stronger effect of over-fitting than do psychedelics themselves. They actual substances because it's a counterculture thing. So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance, if you're a boring person who wears a suit and tie and works at a bank and take psychedelics, that could be a very different effect of psychedelics on, on your mind."
I'm just sort of raising the point that the people you referenced are already weirdos. I'm not sure exactly.
"Yeah. I mean, I love the, the, the metaphor of data augmentation, because that's been the primary driver of self supervised learning in the vision. Computer vision domain is data augmentation. So it's funny to think of data augment, like, like chemical induced data augmentation in the human mind."
"Well, that's why you have to do good science, which they're starting to do on all these different substances of how well it actually works for the different conditions that come DMA seems to help with PTSD. Same of psilocybin that, you know, you need to do good science, meaning large studies of large N yeah."
"Yeah. Well, as far as I know, psilocybin, so mushrooms, magic mushrooms, as far as I know, in terms of the studies that are running, I think have no overdue, like they're allowed to do what they're calling heroic doses. So that one does not have a toxicity. So they can do a huge doses in a clinical setting when they're doing study and psilocybin, which is kind of fun."
Let's talk about AI a little bit. What are your thoughts about GPT three and language models trained with self supervised learning?
And the context is significantly larger than the adjacent ward.
"By the way, I actually didn't check carefully. It's funny. You just mentioned how you coupled semantics to the multiplication. Is it able to do some basic math and two, two digit numbers? Yes. Okay. Interesting. I thought, I thought there's a lot of failure cases. Yeah, it did."
"Humans, aren't very good at doing three digit numbers either."
"But, but the fact that that kind of prediction works to generate texts that's semantically, rich and consistent is interesting. Yeah. So, yeah. So it's amazing that it's able to generate symmetric, consistent texts"
"This, this part as a small tangent, I really don't like in machine learning papers, which they often do anecdotal evidence they'll find like one example is some kind of specific use of Mathematica and demonstrate, look, here's they'll show successes and failures, but they won't have a very clear representation of how many cases is actually represented."
"Well, let me, let me ask again. So I'm using your tweets as if this is like Play-Doh as if this is well thought out novels that you've written you tweeted GPT four is listening to us. Now, this is one way of asking what are the limitations of GP T3 when it scales? So what do you think will be the capabilities of GPT for <inaudible> and so on? What are the limits of this approach?"
"I wrote that tweet in several ways. So one is obviously everything you put on the internet is used this training data, but in a second way, I read it is in a, we talked about agency. I I've read it as almost like GPT fours, intelligent enough to be choosing to listen. So not only like did a programmer tell it to collect this data and use it for training. I almost saw the humorous angle, which is like, it has achieved AGI kind of thing."
"The forest listening, and <inaudible> actually constructed the entirety of the reality"
"Do you think that's fixable within the space of deep learning? Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?"
"So do you think sort of making the systems, like what would you say multi resolution also like some, some of the language models are focused on two pages. Some are focused on two books. Some are focused on two years of reading, some are focused on a lifetime, like just like stacks of it's a GP, T3 is all the way down."
"I wonder what that thing looks like, what the architecture for that, for the thing that's able to have, that kind of model"
Did you think it can still be differentiable? Do you think it's still convenient?
"Yeah. The program, things that tree colonial networks. So let me ask you, it's not quite program synthesis, but the application of these language models to generation two programs, and this is the generation of programs. So if you look at, get hub open pilot, which is based on open AI is codex. I don't know if you've got a chance to look at it, but it's the system that's able to generate code. Once you prompt it with what is it like the header of a function with some comments, it seems to do an incredibly good job or not a perfect job. It's very important, but a incredibly good job of generating functions."
"What do you make of that? Are you, is this exciting or is this just a party trick, a demo or is this revolutionary?"
"That, yeah. Do make it much faster to copy and paste from stack or"
"Yeah. Like literally sometimes as simple as just changing the variable names, so it fits into the rest."
"Yeah. And you can automate some of those things. Yes. The thing that makes people nervous of course, is that I'm a little bit wrong in a program can have a dramatic effect on the actual final operation of that program. So that's one little error, which in, in the space of language, doesn't really matter, but in the space of programs can matter a lot."
"Somehow it becomes scarier. When you know that a program generated code, that's running a nuclear power plant. It becomes scarier. You know, humans have errors too. Exactly. But it's scarier when a program is doing it because Y Y I mean, there's a, there's a fear that a program like a program may not be as good as humans to know when stuff is important to not mess up. Like there's a misalignment of priorities of values."
"That's potential that maybe that's the source of the worry. I mean, okay. If I give you code generated by a get hub, open pilot and code generated by a human and say here, use, use one of these, which, which, how do you select today? And in the next 10 years, which code do you use? Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human"
"Well, th that's a very harsh you're you're, I think that's a harsh, phew view of humanity. There's a lot of bad people, whether they're incompetent or just malevolent in this world. Yes. But it feels like the more malevolent you, so the more damage you do to the world, the more resistance you have in your own human. Like, if not hard,"
"That's not evil. That's I, I tend to, so, no, I, I see that as malevolence. I see, as I even like being a good German, as I told you offline is some, it's not, it's not absolute malevolence, but it's a small amount. It's cowardice. I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world, it's either incompetence. You're not able to see it, or it's cowardice the United able to stand up, not in a, not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way. So I, I do think that is an, a bit of malevolence. I, I'm not sure. The example you're describing is a good,"
"The optimism, I was a little confused by the previous things, just to clarify, it's, there is a kind of underlying morality to having an optimism that human civilization will persist for longer than a hundred years like that. Like, I think a lot of people believe that it's a good thing for us to keep living now, of course, and thriving"
But I believe what exactly. So I would say
"But we're trying, I mean, you're highlighting a lot of the flaws of the different institutions, the systems we're operating under, but I think there's a continued throughout history mechanism, design of trying to design incentives in such a way that these systems behave better and better and better. I mean, it's a very difficult thing to operate a society of hundreds of millions of people effectively with yes."
"I think so. I think, I think it's easy to sort of highlight the, I think we're doing it in the way that like I operate my current life. I didn't sleep much last night. You would say that Lex, the way you need to operate your life is you need to always get sleep. The fact that you didn't sleep last night is, is totally the wrong way to operate in your life. Like you should have gotten all your shit done in time and gotten to sleep because sleep is very important for health and you're highlighting, look, this person is not sleeping. Look, the, the medical, the healthcare system is operating poor. But the point is that we just, it seems like this is the way, especially in the capitalist society, we operate, we keep running into trouble."
"In last minute, we tried to get our, our way out through innovation. And it seems to work. You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying to build a better world and, and get urgency about them when it's, the problem becomes more and more imminent. And that's the way this operates. But if you look at the, the, the history, the, the long arc of history, it seems like that operating on deadlines produces progress and builds better and better systems"
"First of all, so what do you, what do you wanna like put before the firing squad? I think they are"
"But it's not that yes, they're being held responsible by many voices by people being frustrated. There's new leaders being born. Now that we're going to see rise to the top and 10 years, this moves slower than there's obviously a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy in these systems move slowly. They move, you know, like science one death at a time. So like th yes, I think the, the pain has been felt in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world."
"I, I disagree. I think this is the virus was much deadlier. We would see a very different response. I think the virus was not as efficiently, deadly, and instead, because it wasn't very deadly. What happened is the, the, the current system started to politicize it, the mask. This is what I realized with masks early on. They were not very quickly became not as a solution, but they became a thing that politicians use to divide the country. So that the same thing has happened with vaccine, same thing. So like, nobody's really people weren't talking about solutions to this problem, because I don't think the problem was bad enough when you talk about the war, the war. I think what I think our lives are too comfortable."
"I think in a, in the developed world, things are too good and we're not faced severe dangers. One that the danger, the severe dangers existential threats are faced. That's when we step up on a small scale in a large scale. Now, I don't, I that's sort of my argument here, but I did think the virus is, I was hoping that it was actually sufficiently dangerous for us to step up, because especially in the early days, it was unclear. It's still is unclear because of mutations, how bad it might be. Right. And so I thought we would step up."
"And even, so the masks point is, is, is a tricky one because to me, the manufacturer of masks, isn't, isn't even the problem. I'm still to this day. And I was involved with, with, with a bunch of this work, have not seen good signs done on whether masks work or not. Like there still has not been a large scale study to me that should be, there should be large-scale studies and every possible solution, like aggressive in the same way that the vaccine development was aggressive. There should be masks, which tests, what kind of tests work really well? What kind of like, even the question of how the virus spreads there should be aggressive studies on that to understand I'm still, as far as far as I know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about that."
"Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem that needs to be solved. It's it's that I was surprised about, but that's,"
"Well, I think it goes in cycles because the what's going to happen is all of the small business owners, all of the people who truly are suffering and will suffer more because the effects of the closure of the economy and the lack of solutions to the virus, they're going to uprise. And hopefully, I mean, this is, this is where charismatic leaders can get the, the world in trouble, but hopefully it will elect great leaders"
"That will break through this post-modernist idea of, of the media and the perception and the drama on Twitter and all that kinda stuff."
"Do you think from a historical perspective, Hitler could have been stopped from within Germany or from outside, or this well, depends on who you want to focus, whether you want to focus on Stalin or Hitler, but it feels like Hitler was the one as a political movement that could have been stopped."
"I mean, I, I, I wonder if Hitler is uniquely, I want to carefully use this term, but uniquely evil. So if Hitler was never born, if somebody else would come in this place. So like, just thinking about the progress of history, how important are those singular figures that, that lead to mass destruction and cruelty? Because my sense is Hitler was unique."
"The, it wasn't just about the environment and the context that gave him, like, like another person would not come in his place to do as destructive of, of the things that he did. There was a combination of charisma, of madness, of psychopathy, of just ego, all of those things, which are very unlikely to come together in one person in the right time."
"Yeah. And it all just starts with one monkey on charismatic ape, and there's a bunch of them throughout history."
"Okay. Speaking of which, I love how we went to Hitler and stolen from 20, 30 minutes ago, GPT three, generating PR doing programs that this is the argument was about morality of AI versus human. So, and specifically in the context of writing programs specifically in the context of programs that can be destructive. So running nuclear power plants, or autonomous weapon system, for example, and I think your inclination was to say that it's not so obvious that AI would be less moral than humans or less effective at making a world that would make humans"
"So, but so humans versus AI, let me give you an example, autonomous weapon system, let's say there's a city somewhere in the middle east that has a number of terrorists. And the question is what's currently done with, with drone technologies. You have information about the location of a particular terrorists, and you have a targeted attack. You have a bombing of that particular building, and that's all directed by humans at the high level strategy, and also at the deployment of individual bombs and missiles like that. The actual everything is done by human, except the, the final targeting and the, the like the country was spot similar thing."
"They control the flight. Okay. What if you give AI control and saying, write a program that says here's the best information I have available about the location of these five terrorists. Here's the city, make sure it's all the bombing you do is constrained to the city. Make sure it's precision based, but you take care of it. So you do one level of abstraction out and saying, take care of the terrorist and the city, which are you more comfortable with the humans or the JavaScript GPT three generated code. That's doing the deployment. I mean, that's, this is the kind of question I'm asking is the kind of bugs that we see in human nature."
Are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI?
"So there's something about right, it's automation, but there's something about the, there's a certain level of obstruction where you give control to AI to do the automation. There's a scale that can be achieved, that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake, and scale of destruction that can be achieved of the kind that humans cannot achieve. So AI is much more able to destroy an entire country accidentally versus humans. It feels like the more civilians die as a react or suffer as a consequences of your decisions, the more weight there is on the human mind to make that decision."
"And so, like, it becomes more and more unlikely to make that decision for humans, for AI, it feels like it's harder to encode that kind of weight"
"So the question is how hard is it to encode, to, to pro, to properly encode the right incentives into the,"
"Though. AI is still going to be unreliable, perhaps less so than humans, but it will be unreliable in novel ways. And"
"Well, and also who creates the AI who controls it, who makes money from it because it's ultimately humans. And then you start talking about how much do you trust the humans?"
"Yeah, it's nice for those incentives to be transparent. So for example, I'll give, I'll give you example, the, there seems to be a significant distrust of tech like entrepreneurs in the tech space or, or people that run. For example, social media companies like mark, mark Zuckerberg. There's not a complete transparency of incentives under which that particular human being operates. The tr you know, we can listen to the words he says or what the marketing team says for a company, but we don't know. And that's, that's becomes a problem when that the algorithms and the systems created by him and other people in that company start having more and more impact on society."
"And that it starts, you know, if, if the incentives were somehow the definition and the explainability of the incentives was decentralized such that no, nobody can manipulate it, no propaganda type manipulation of like how these systems actually could be done then yes, if you're not, I think, I think AI could achieve much fairer, much more effective sort of like solutions to difficult ethical problems. But when there's like humans in the loop, manipulating the S the, the, the dissemination of the communication of how the system actually works, that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble."
"And that's why there's currently a lot of distrust for, for people at the heads of companies that have increasingly powerful AI systems."
Farmer you're referring to in Texas. Yes. I had dinner with him a couple of times. Okay.
And
"So crucially important, but the only qualification currently needed is to be outraged by the injustice in the world."
"I generally have a very foggy view of that world, but I tend to try to follow. And I think society should, in some degree, follow the gradient of love, increasing the amount of love in the world. And whenever I see different policies or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so obviously that that's the ones that kind of resist."
"You're just manipulating. I mean, that's, it's, you have to be very careful. You're, you're talking to the wrong person well, in this way about, well,"
"But the, the size of the other that you include needs to be maximized. So it's, it's basically appreciation like deep appreciation of the world around you fully like including the people that are very different than you. The people that disagree with you completely, including people, including living creatures, outside of just people, including ideas and appreciation of the full mess of it. And also has to do with like empathy, which is coupled with a lack of confidence and certainty about, of your own rightness."
It's like an open radical open-mindedness to the way forward.
"Th th there's a kind of, there's kind of ways to deal. I mean, Hitler is an easier case, but perhaps he wasn't so easy in the thirties, right. To understand who is Hitler and who's not,"
"Yeah. I mean, it's difficult. Love, love is complicated because you can't just be, so open-minded that you let evil walk into the door, but you can't be so self self-assured that you, you can always identify evil perfectly because that's what leads to Nazi Germany, having a certainty of what is, and wasn't evil, like always drawing lines of good versus evil. There seems to be, there has to be a dance between like hard stances extending up against what is wrong."
"And at the same time, empathy and open mindness of, towards not knowing what is right and wrong and like a dance between those."
"And you're saying in terms of, of all the, of all the ways that society can operate, perhaps the preservation of innocence might be one, might be one of the best."
"So like to ask about associates and our individual role as ants in this very large society. So he says that some version of the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, do you think all of us are capable of good and evil? Like what's our role in this play in this game? We're all playing. Is all of us capable to play any role? Like, is there an ultimate responsibility to, you mentioned maintaining innocence or whatever, the, whatever, the highest ideal for society you want are all of us capable of living up to that and that's our responsibility or, or is there significant limitations to what we're able to do in terms of good and evil?"
"No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic, like within your sense of what is good and evil, I was still, it seems like we're still able to commit evil."
"So if you look at life like starting today or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today, there's a bunch of trajectories that you can take through life, maybe countless. Do you think some of these trajectories in your own conception of yourself, some of those trajectories are the ideal life, a life that if you were to be the hero of your life story, you would want to be like, is there some Joshua Bhakti is striving to be like, this is the question I asked myself as an individual, trying to make a better world in the best way that I could conceive of what is my responsibility there and how much am I responsible for the failure to do so."
"Cause I'm, I'm lazy and incompetent too often in my own perception"
"So I, I want to clarify the here, I didn't mean status or perception or like some kind of marketing thing, but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind, is there the kind of man you want to be and would consider it a failure if you don't become that? That's what I'm meant by here."
And it's also sometimes frustrating.
"It's interesting. I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river. I worry that sometimes it's more like being the river. I'm just a fat frog sitting in the leaf. I know a dirty muddy lake waiting for princess to kiss me or the other way I forgot which way it goes. Somebody kisses. Somebody. Can I ask you, I don't know if you know who Michael mouse is, but in terms of constructing sense systems of incentives, it's, it's interesting to ask."
"I don't think I've talked to you about this before malice, spouses anarchism. So he sees all government as fundamentally that getting in the way, or even being destructive to collaborations between human beings, thriving, what do you think what's the role of government in a society that, that thrives is a anarchism at all, compelling to you as a system for like, not just small government, but no government at all."
"So the argument there is that you can have collectives like governing organizations, but not government, like where you're born in a particular set of land. And therefore you must follow this rule or else you're forced by what they call violence, because there's an, there's an implied violence here. So would government, the key, the key aspect of government is, is it protects you from the rest of the world with an army and with police, right? So there's this, it has a monopoly on violence. It's the only one that's able to divide it,"
"So the idea is that you might be able to, to achieve that and just stay with companies. So with, with the forces of capitalism is create security companies where the one that's most ethically sound rises to the top. Basically it would be a much better representative of the people because there is a less sort of stickiness to the, the big military force sticking around, even though it's long, over lived outlet"
"I always see, I D my, as what I was trying to argue with malice, I feel like it always convergence though, as government at scale. But I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives that are you basically never let anything scale too big. So one of the problems with governments is it gets too big in terms of like the, the, the, the size of the group over, which it has control. My sense is that would happen anyway in this. So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook, I mean, it, it starts forming a monopoly over, over entire populations, not over just a hundred hundreds of millions, but billions of people."
"So I don't know, but there is something about the abuses of power the government can have when it has a monopoly on violence, right? And so that's, that's a tension there, but"
"Yeah. I mean, the, there there's a sense in which it seems like the reason government, the parts of government that don't work well currently is because there's not good mechanisms for, through which to interact for the citizenry to interact with government is basically it, it hasn't caught up in terms of technology. And I think once you integrate some of the digital revolution of, of being able to have a lot of access to data, be able to vote on different ideas at a local level, at all levels at the, at the optimal level, like you're saying that can resolve the, the presenter dilemmas and to integrate AI, to help you out automate things that are like that don't require the human ingenuity."
"I feel like that's, that's where government could operate that well, and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies if needed, there'll be a strong incentive to, to, to be efficient and successful."
"So w can you Intuit, why utopias fail as, as systems? So like having a utopia that's out there beyond the horizon, is it because then, so it's not only because it's impossible to achieve utopias, but it's because what certain humans, certain small number of humans start to sort of greedily attained, power and money and control and influence as they become, as they see the power in using this idea of a utility,"
"You have to design a system where I'm in listen, communism also was quote, unquote incentivized to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia is just it wasn't working, given human. Initially the incentives were not correct."
"So you're, you're describing capitalism."
"I, I understand. I, I, I think there is, yeah. I, I, maybe some people probably, I would push back against that definition of the middle class. It does feel like the middle-class is pretty large, but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth. So there's a big wealth gap."
"Well, but also some people like to be frugal, even when they're billionaires. Okay. So like that, let's take that into account."
"I don't, although the, the, the fight here, there's two crying babies next to me. So that, but that has nothing to do with the common it has to do with crime babies. There. They're very cute though. So yeah,"
"Is it true? That, so when you're a father, you, you grow immune to the crying and all that kind of stuff. Like the cause like me just not having kids, it can be other people's kids can be quite annoying when they're crying and screaming and all that"
I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion. I love it. So w
"Cause you said like a fundamental aspect of that is, is love. That makes it all worth it. What, in this a monkey riding an elephant in a dream world, what role does love play in the human condition?"
"But the, I mean, the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit is a kind of transaction."
Take that Neanderthals. Yeah.
"Yeah. I, I wonder what that, the, the peculiar characteristics of that group. Yeah. I mean, we can never know a lot of people do and we can only, we can only just listen to the echos in our, like the, the, the ripples that, that are still within us."
Do to form collectors outside of the direct collective.
Oh. So we had to murder a lot of people that weren't about love. So love led to
"For young people today in high school, in college, they're thinking about what to do with their career, with their life. So that at the end of the whole thing, they could be proud of what they did."
So what does integrity look like when you're the river or the leaf or the fat frog in a lake?
"I come to realize this recently there is an inner voice that tells you what's right and wrong. And speaking of reading the room, there's times what integrity looks like is there's times a lot of people are doing something wrong and what integrity looks like is not going on Twitter and tweeting about it, but not participating quietly, not doing so. It's not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff, but actually living your, what you think is right, like living it, not yet."
"Yeah. This that's such a thank you for saying that that's such a hopeful message that no matter what happens to you, there'll be a place there's people you'll meet that also have what you have, and you will find happiness there and safety there."
"And ultimately be grateful, no matter what happens. Cause even just being alive is pretty damn nice."
"It's all the training I speak in a, which on said, I see many people die because they judged that life is not worth. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living. What is called. The reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying. I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions. So I have to ask what Joshua Bach is, the meaning of life. It is an urgent question. According to come on,"
"I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create the most vibrant, the most weird, the most unique kind of blip you can given your environment, given your set of skills, just be the most weird set of like local pocket of complexity. You can be. So that like when people study the universe, they'll pause and be like, ah, that's weird."
"In a dream that's, that's hardly in touch with the reality. Okay."
"And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am,"
"Josh, you're, you're one, the most incredible people. I know. I really loved talking to talking to you again, and it's really an honor that you spend your valuable time with me. I hope we get to talk many times throughout our, through our short and meaningless lives, meaningful or meaningful."
